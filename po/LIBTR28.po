"Now several employees are revealing that such doping products should also be "
"banned from the board room. Interns have complained of 'roid rages' and "
"terrifying outbreaks of acne. One former Eris employee told us, \"Pete has "

"his testicles to shrink, he'd often use golf balls inside his cycling shorts "
