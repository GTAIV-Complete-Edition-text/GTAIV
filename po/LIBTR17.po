"Following the massive rise in shootings recently in eastern Broker, police "
"warned of a new danger lurking for residents - arson. Two buildings "
"including a taxi garage were recently gutted by fire. Although two men were "
"seen starting the fire with Molotov cocktails, no arrests have been made. We "
"will stay with this story if we can find something interesting to say. In "
"the meantime, be very suspicious of anyone buying vodka, matches and a gas "
"soaked rag, but try not to panic. Local police were appealing for calm and "
"also lots of snitches and widespread anxiety."

"and are romanticized in video games and TV shows. They are thought to stand "
