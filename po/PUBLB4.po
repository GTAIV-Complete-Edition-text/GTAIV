"Now, he's turning his attention to political corruption. He is investigating "
"top brass in the LCPD with a view to rooting out all that is wrong with that "
"sinister conservative institution. We asked Mr. Goldberg what he thought was "
"the next step for him after the city government has taken notice of his "

"you can sue a tobacco company for giving you lung cancer, why can't you sue "
