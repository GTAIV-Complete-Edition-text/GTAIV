"Despite our repeated warnings, terrorists have attacked Liberty City again. "
"This time the target was a fueling depot in Northwood. Some liberal news "
"outlets are trying to spin this into a story about the Mafia. They're saying "
"that the explosion was related to organized crime rather than terror. These "
"leftist loons are crazy. They'll say and do anything before they admit that "
"terrorism is the number one problem facing the nation and much more "
"important than any of their pet projects, the environment, health care and "
"ludicrous foreign welfare projects."

"尽管警报不断播报，恐怖分子还是袭击了自由城。这次的袭击目标是位于Northwood的一个燃料仓库。某些自由派新闻媒体妄图把本次事件编造成黑手党所为。他们称"
"本次爆炸事件应归类到有组织犯罪案件，而非恐怖袭击。这些左派野蛮人简直就是疯子。他们无论如何都不会承认，解决恐怖主义问题才是我国的燃眉之急，他们只会关注宠物"
"、环保、医保和滑稽的外国福利保障。"

"Proof that the government is doing all that it can to protect home owners "
"and families came through from Liberty City with the news that, in a city in "
"which not much goes right, the cost of living remains reassuringly high. "
"Although the city is plagued by social problems, and has a massive shortfall "
"of strip malls and obesity compared with rest of this great nation, at least "
"they are keeping the economy strong."

"在自由城这个诸事不顺的城市中，生活成本仍然高得令人安心，证明政府正在尽全力保护房主和家庭的利益。尽管这里社会问题繁多，小商场的缺口巨大，肥胖问题对比全国格"

"Even more alarming, the LCPD forensic team has found a triggering device at "
"the scene which may have been activated by a cell phone. It is more than "
"likely that this was just the first of many planned bombings. If you see a "
"foreigner using a cell phone, he is probably a terrorist. Act first, ask "
"questions later. You have the safety of your fellow Americans to consider as "
"well as your own."

"更可怕的是，LCPD鉴证科还在现场发现了一个起爆器，可能是通过手机进行操作。这多半会是连环爆炸袭击的开端。要是你瞧见一个外国人在用手机，他很可能是恐怖分子"
"。记住，先行动，后提问。你要考虑的不只是自己的安全，还有美国同胞的。"

"While this is bad news for some, it's good news for us as we are big "
"supporters of those who help themselves. Especially when those who help "
"themselves are the already wealthy figuring out a way to stay rich. Above "
"all, good house prices are good for us as we have literally nothing else to "

"对我们这些坚定的自食其力派们来说，这确是一个好消息，对某些人来说则不然。自食其力者富起来后想要保持富裕，这种情况就会凸显。最重要的是，房价高对我们都有好处"
"，不然我们在饭桌上就真的没啥可聊了。毕竟我们都在80年代长大成人，所以也就错过了嬉皮士，错过了性开放，也错过了那些奇思妙想。"
