"Diminutive playboy and internet millionaire, Tony McTony, today announced "
"plans to sue LC24 magazine because they had referred to him as Napoleonic. "
"The bling-wearing little man is, he claims, five foot three. Napoleon, his "
"lawyer points out, was only five foot two. Plus Mr. McTony objects to the "
"idea that he has any complexes. He commented, \"I am a complex man, but I "
"aint got no complex - why should I when I am perfect? Complexes is for "
"people who want to sleep with their mommas. I mean, I love my moms, but I "

"McTony于今日宣布，他正在计划起诉LC24杂志，因为他们称他为拿破仑式人物。这位穿得金光闪闪的矮小男士自称身高5英尺3英寸(约1."

"先生反对所谓「他有某某『情结』」的说法，他说：「我是一个复杂*的人，但是我并没有任何『情结*』(注：复杂与情节均为complex)，我这么完美的人，要什么"
"『情结』？『情结』是那些想睡他妈的人才会有的。我不是说我不爱我的母亲，但我还没到那种程度。」我们会为您持续报导后续内容。"

"While the target's mob links may just be a coincidence, sources close to the "
"Liberty Tree suggest it is much more likely that Tony Black was hit because "
"he acted as a conduit between the Ancelottis and the Albanian street gang "
"they use as muscle. Either the street gang wanted to be taken more seriously "
"and eliminated their employer, or another mafia family decided to take out "
"the competition. Terrorists are not known for sticking around long enough to "
"give their victims two in the back of the head, are they? Whether hitmen or "
"terrorists blew up the warehouse, residents of Liberty City can be sure of "
"one thing - this city is not safe."

"尽管死者的黑帮背景可能是巧合，但Liberty Tree的消息灵通人士指出，Tony Black遇袭更有可能是因为他充当了Ancelotti家族和阿尔巴尼"
"亚帮间的桥梁，而后者是前者雇佣的打手。要么是后者想通过杀害雇主显示自己的能力，要么是其他黑手党家族对竞争对手发起袭击。一般的恐怖分子可不会在袭击现场久留，"
"枪杀现场的幸存者吧？总之，无论引爆仓库的是杀手还是恐怖分子，自由城的居民都可以确定一点——这里并不安全。"
