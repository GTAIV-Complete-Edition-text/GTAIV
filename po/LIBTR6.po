"Liberty City's Police Commissioner for Public Affairs, Tom Pireni, responded "
"yesterday to the recent explosion in violent crime by laying the blame "
"squarely at the feet of those who try to stop the police from doing their "
"job better: the general public. He commented that, \"The police don't get "
"the respect they deserve and, quite frankly, never have. We do a very "
"dangerous job, and have a lot of quotas to fill. To blame police priorities "
"for rising crime is patently absurd. When arresting jay walkers or "
"protecting film sets around the city, our officers are more than willing to "
"get involved in any violent incidents that occur. The fact is that stopping "
"violent crime does not put any money into this city's coffers, whereas "
"annoying motorists is very lucrative and ensures our pensions remain intact."

"LCPD公共事务处处长Tom Pireni昨日对最近陡增的暴力犯罪率做出回应，将责任直接推到了那些试图阻止警察更好地工作的人身上：普罗大众。他说：「警方并"
"未得到应有的尊重，说句实话，从来没有。我们的工作十分危险，而且还要达成很多指标。将犯罪率上升归咎于警察不作为十分荒谬。比起逮捕闯红灯的人和保护电影布景，我"
"们的执法人员更愿意处理暴力犯罪案件。但实际上，阻止暴力犯罪并不会给城市财政带来任何收入，而那些危险驾驶人却往往能带来收益，还能确保我们的养老金不被削减。」"
