"We lived for months in a city divided. Some of us loved it. Bridge and "
"tunnel types in the city were no more. It was great. You could go out again "
"on a Saturday night. You felt important, like you were living in a war zone, "
"only nothing bad happened. You thought of yourself as a survivor. Then they "
"took it all away. They callously opened the bridges. The city returned to "
"normal. I for one had nothing to talk about. Now the city is still a mess, "
"only its issues are too complex for me to grasp. One urban planner has "
"suggested that, given the chronic traffic and crime problems in the city, "
"the best thing to do would be to close the bridges and tunnels again. I for "
"one agree. I need something to talk about."

"无法理解。一位城市规划师建议，考虑到城里长期存在的交通问题和犯罪问题，最优解是再次关闭桥梁和隧道。这我同意，我需要能评价的东西。"
