"The Liberty City metropolitan area continues to be the main target for "

"It's un-American of us to question that. N.O.O.S.E has said that a number of "
"suspects have been extracted to offshore questioning centers. All I can say "
"is thank god for that constitutional loophole."

"果国安办告诉我们这些屠杀都是恐怖袭击，那它们就是恐怖袭击。谁敢质疑这一点，谁就是反美国。国安办说嫌疑人已被运送到沿海的讯问中心，现在我只能说有那些宪法漏洞"
