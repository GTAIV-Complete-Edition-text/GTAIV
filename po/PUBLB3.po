"A blast from the past today as former talk show host Lazlow is trying to get "
"back on the airwaves. Lazlow used to host a popular show on a station called "
"Chatterbox at the turn of the millennium, then things turned bad for him and "
"he disappeared from our airwaves after a string of personal humiliations and "
"bad choices, including several payola scandals, and a series of sexual "
"shenanigans led to major credibility issues. But it appears he is back. Or "
"trying to get back. He's been trying to raise financing for a new radio "
"station to be launched in Liberty City in which the listener is put right "
"into the action. "

"said, \"This is radio 2.0, this is Lazlow 2.0, I'm back.\" When asked to "
"explain what on earth this could mean, the popular shock jock said, \"I "
