"City Councilor Doris Fung, long accused of having links with several "
"Chinatown gangs made a statement to the press, \"Those who died on the docks "
"were the victims of this crime, not the perpetrators. We shouldn't be asking "
"who they were working for, why they had weapons or why they were on the "
"docks in the first place. We should be asking who killed these young men.\" "

"This time it was a young dance instructor from Broker who had his head "
"removed, but police are struggling to see a pattern or get any traction on "
"the case. Detective Jon Atkinson, who is covering the case, said, \"To be "
"honest, it's down to underfunding - unless the police force are given better "
"overtime and better pensions, there is no way this guy can be caught. But I "
"want everyone to know, I will be writing a book about this case, and anyone "
"trying to beat me to market will be sued if they mention my name. It's a "
"tragedy.\" When asked about how he would respond to the on-going naming "
"crisis that bedevils this case, he said, \"It's awful. These people have "

"这次的受害者是一位住在Broker年轻的舞蹈老师，尸体没有头部，但警方却仍在全力进行调查。负责此案的Jon Atkinson说：「说实话，都是因为资金不足"
"。除非增加警队的加班费和养老金，否则我们不可能抓到这个罪犯。但我要在此通知一件事，我会就本案写一本书，任何想抢在我之前推出竞品的人，只要在书中提到我的名字"
"就会被起诉。真是悲剧。」当被问及他对困扰本案的凶手命名风波有何回应时，他表示：「实在是太糟了。受害者都白白牺牲了，我的市场竞争也将无从谈起。」"

"The bodies of several men have been found at the docks in Fishmarket South. "
"Authorities believe they may have been members of a \"triad\" street gang "
"smuggling contraband into Liberty City. Last year's prosecution of several "
"members of the Dockworker's Union led to allegations of widespread "

"into the United States, \"It is only a matter of time before a terrorist "
