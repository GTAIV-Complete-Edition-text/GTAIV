"dancer and now fiancée sign an extensive pre-nuptial agreement. However, the "
"pony-tailed backing dancer caught everybody by surprise when he responded "
"yesterday with a dowry request for a staggering $3 million. \"I've been in "

"Elizabeta Torres, a drug dealer from South Bohan, was handed a record prison "
"sentence at the Civic Citadel yesterday. Liberty City Judge, Mitt Burrows, "
"slapped her with a 300 year stretch for thirty counts of cocaine "
"distribution. It is also believed that Torres murdered Bohan community "
"leader, Manny Escuela, and documentary film maker, Jay Hamilton. They have "
"been missing for several weeks but police cannot bring charges until their "
"bodies are discovered. The District Attorney submitted hundreds of hours of "
"surveillance audio in the trial. These tapes provided evidence of her "
"working with international drug rings. The last tape before her arrest, "
"played at her trial yesterday, features a heated conversation between her, a "
"Jamaican man and an Eastern European man. Authorities have been unable to "
