"With the murder of heroic attorney, Tom Goldberg, a blow has been struck to "
"the heart of the first amendment and freedom fighters everywhere. A moment "
"of silence was called in the blogosphere as Mr. Goldberg stood for the "
"freedom of speech and the rights of the little man to slander people "
"anonymously online with no repercussions. He was in favor of immigration and "
"proposed much tighter gun control. No wonder so few conservatives are "
"mourning. He stood up to corporate America and the links between big "
"business and government."
