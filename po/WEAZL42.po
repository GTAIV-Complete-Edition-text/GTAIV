"Alright, so Bobby Jefferson went out of his way to praise some immigrants "
"while he was damning others in his speech at the Civic Citadel. He argued "
"that 99% of the people who come into this country are honest (I'd like to "
"see the statistics to back that one up, by the way) and believe in the same "
"things that patriotic American citizens do. He then went on to say that, "
"besides terrorism, the biggest threat to American safety at the moment is "
"these gangsters coming into Liberty City from Russia and Eastern Europe and "
"setting up shop in immigrant communities like Hove Beach."

"Firstly, if people are going to come over to our country they should adopt "

"language, even if we haven't quite properly mastered it yet. They shouldn't "
"go somewhere like Hove Beach which is more Russian than some parts of "
"Moscow. If these guys are such a threat, then why don't we just close the "

"首先，如果有人想移民我们国家，他们应该学会适应我们的肥佬习惯、爱上垃圾情景剧。同时，还要学习我们的语言，尽管我们自己也没有完全掌握。"

"For years, sneaker manufacturer Eris has been made the villain by work-shy "
"lefties for choosing to help third world countries. Historically, Eris's "
"visionary founder, Pete Vassal, has kept quiet, refusing to descend to the "
"level of veggie hypocrites who are more than happy to take a welfare check "
