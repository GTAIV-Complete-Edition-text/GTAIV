"The serial killer they couldn't name has been found. Dead. The killer is "
"believed to have killed up to 10 people over the last few months, usually "
"joggers or nighttime strollers. Police believe he attacked the wrong person, "
"and was himself killed in a fight. Detective Jon Atkinson told this "
"newspaper, \"It is very disappointing. I was just about to make an arrest. "
"I'd solved the case. His name was Eddie Low. He lived in Dukes - I was "
"literally heading over to his house when the news came in another body had "
