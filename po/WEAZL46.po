"Now, he's also come out as a homosexual, married with children. Well, it's "
"scarcely surprising. He's a liberal. Wooly thinking is their watchword. Or "
"watch words. This news organization can never be accused of wooly thinking ("
"apart from our weird attitude to China, but let's ignore that), so we will "
"continue to attack liberals like him, until we have driven them out of this "
"country for good."

"Disgraced sinner, Bryce Dawkins, was hiding a terrible secret. He lived a "
"double life. In public, he was a staunch hang 'em and flog 'em conservative, "
"but in private, he was a filthy liberal. The fact is Mr. Dawkins was not as "
"conservative as he made out. He even owned a passport. Most terrorists own "
"passports, as do many drug dealers."

"私下，他完全是一个肮脏猥琐的自由派。事实上，Dawkins先生并没有表面上那么保守。他甚至还有护照。而绝大多数恐怖分子都持有护照，许多毒贩也是如此。"
