"One disgruntled fanboy, blogging from his parents' basement in Broker, told "
"the Liberty Tree, \"Girls aren't allowed to touch Eunux. Just like I don't "
"want to get on a plane with a female pilot, I don't want some chick messing "
"around with my source code. We deliberately create ugly interfaces and make "
"it as hard as possible to install programs in order to discourage women. "
"First they start drinking beer and now this. Is nothing sacred any more? "
"What next, a female president? I've tried speaking to girls in real life but "
"all they do is laugh at me. I hope her kernel explodes.\" Many are already "
"drawing parallels between this story and the female plumber who was run out "
"of a San Andreas town last year."

"一个在Broker的父母家地下室写博客的男性Eunux死忠向Liberty Tree表达了不满：「女性是不能碰Eunux的。就像我不想乘女飞行员开的飞机一"
"样，我也不想让哪个小妞乱搞我的源码。我们故意把界面做丑，还把装程序搞得很复杂，就是为了劝退女人。她们先是开始喝啤酒，现在又来这个。真就什么都敢染指了是吧？"
"然后呢，选个女总统？我有在现实中试过和女孩子说话，但她们只会嘲笑我。我祝她内核爆炸。」许多人已经把这件事与去年逃出圣安地列斯某镇的女水管工联系起来了。"

"Mob Boss, Jon Gravelli, alleged head of the Gambetti crime family, died "
"peacefully in his sleep last night. Mr. Gravelli, 85, had been residing at "
"the Schottler Medical Center for the last 3 years. Although some in the DA's "
"office argued that this was a ruse to avoid a court case, Mr. Gravelli never "
"left hospital after being admitted. Mr. Gravelli has been head of the "
"Gambetti crime syndicate since 1978 and under his stewardship, the family "
"had become the most powerful of Liberty City's crime families, rivaling the "
"Pavano family. Although he had been indicted several times, Mr. Gravelli was "
"never convicted of a serious crime. Some believed he had contacts within the "
"government who protected him, and for whom he would get criminal associates "
"to perform hits and other crimes, but these allegations were never "
"substantiated. What happens now to the delicate balance of power amongst "
"criminal gangs within Liberty City is unknown. It is unlikely to be pretty."
