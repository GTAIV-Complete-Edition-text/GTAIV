"The music was powerful, the conversations were earnest and the sex was mind-"
"blowing. It seemed like the party was never going to end. Then it did. You "
"got a bit fat around the middle. You began having serious conversations "
"about mortgages. Ravers and party goers emerged from the best decade of "
"their lives only to be hit with the grim reality that they were going to pay "
"the price for all that fun. Ten years later, people are starting to worry "
"when all the devastating long-term effects are going to kick in. The answer "
"is any minute. \"Every time I get a cold or forget my keys, I am convinced "
"that it's the beginning of the end; that I'm going to be found rocking in "
"darkened room in a state of permanent catatonia from all that LSD, Ecstasy "
"and weed I did,\" said James, a 33-year-old lawyer from Algonquin, \"If it "
"doesn't happen soon, I'm going to dust off the white gloves and glow sticks "
"and get back out there.\""

"，我马上就会在小黑屋里满地打滚，患上永久的紧张症了。不过要是还有很久才会付出代价，我大概会戴上白手套、拿出荧光棒回到那里吧。」"

"The tragic death of Charles Pathmanson became even more tragic as "
