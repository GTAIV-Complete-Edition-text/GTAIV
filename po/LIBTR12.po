"The police are demanding greater funds and expect massive public anxiety "
"over the matter. One criminal expert, Jimmy Cast, is less convinced. The "
"well-known expert on organized crime in our city commented, \"There will "
"always be gangs of criminals at work, especially when you have a lot of poor "
"immigrants, but the idea that they will ever supersede the Mafia in "
"importance is frankly laughable, as they will never be able to take control "
"of so many government and city departments. Of course, following years of "
"being attacked by law enforcement, the Mafia are in decline, but bear in "
"mind it also serves them to exaggerate the extent of their decline so people "
"leave them alone.\" Whichever way you look at it, crime in Liberty City "
"remains an international business and something we do best."

"们的颓势只会帮助他们淡出公众视线，让他们得以隐蔽生长。」无论你的观点如何，自由城的犯罪都会保持国际化的现状，也仍是我们这儿的特产。"

"The Swingers have announced to baseball officials that they will officially "

"Once it was the Mafia, the Jewish mob and the fighting Irish. Now it is "
"Albanian, Russian, Jamaican and Korean hoodlums who are as likely to be "
"running rackets and dealing drugs. Crime in Liberty has changed as the "
"population has changed, and the recent bloodbath in a Hove Beach nightclub "
"has shone a light on the murky world of the underworld. The police have few "
"links with these newer communities in our city, and language barriers often "
"make it harder for them to find out what is going on, so crime has run riot "
"in a way not seen since the passing of the RICO act in the 1970s."
