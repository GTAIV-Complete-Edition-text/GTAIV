"There was another brutal murder in Hove Beach today. This time, however, "
"police do not believe it is related to the ever-tightening hold of the "
"Russian mafia on the area. The victim, a Mr. Tom Rivas, had told the owner "
"of the 69th Street Diner that he was on a \"hot date.\" He was then seen in "
"a romantic context with an older, \"foreign-looking\" man. Moments later, he "
"was dead. Mr. Rivas was unemployed but is reported to have had a number of "
"older boyfriends who supported him. Police are currently pursuing all leads "
"in the hope that one will lead them to the killer."

"今天在Hove Beach又发生了一起残忍的谋杀。然而，警方认为这起谋杀与在当地势力渐增的俄罗斯黑帮无关。受害者是Tom Rivas先生，遇害前他告诉69"
"街餐馆的老板，自己是来「激情约会」的。有人目击受害者与一位年迈的、「长得像外国人」的男子卿卿我我。片刻之后，他死了。Rivas当时没有工作，但有消息称其有"
"许多年长的男友作为经济来源。警方目前正在追查所有线索，希望能找到凶手。"

"Another shipment of cloned medication was intercepted at the docks today. "
"The haul included counterfeit drugs used to treat depression and erectile "
"dysfunction. A spokesman for Betta Pharmaceuticals, producer of the erectile "
"dysfunction treatment drug, Mollis, has warned of the harmful effects of "
"cloned medication. \"Not only do these actions undermine the economy, but "
"they can be very dangerous. We spend years putting our drugs through "
"clinical trials and giving lab monkeys exploding erections. These guys brew "
"something up in their basement and illegally ship it into the marketplace.\" "
"Last year, a man in Las Venturas took some cloned Mollis and accidentally "
"killed his wife when the toxic brew caused him to experience 18 days of "
"priapism."

"今日，码头又截获了一批仿制药，包括治疗抑郁症和勃起功能障碍的药物。生产治疗勃起功能障碍药物Mollis的贝塔制药的一位发言人对仿制药物的有害影响作出预警："
"「走私仿制药不仅破坏经济，还非常危险。我们花了数年时间才让我们的药通过临床试验，让实验室里的猴子雄风大振。这些人就在地下室酿了些东西，然后非法流入市场。」"
"去年，Las Venturas一男子服用仿制的Mollis，这一毒药让他持续勃起18天，害死了其妻子。"
