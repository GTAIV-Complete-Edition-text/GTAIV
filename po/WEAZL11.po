"Again, Liberty City shakes with the sound of a large explosion. In response, "
"our liberal Mayor, Julio Ochoa, has raised the terror threat level to Black "
"8. Residents of South Bohan would have been better off with a warning "
"yesterday, Mr. Mayor. A Russian immigrant, Kenny Petrovic, owns the garage. "

"to target this business, we know not. But this does illustrate the point "
"that no one is safe. The enemy can just as easily attack a privately-owned "
"business as a national institution."

"zones around the world really are."
