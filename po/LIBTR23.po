"The Liberty Tree goes 2.0 with a whole new business plan. In light of the "
"recent report by the National Library Center that the net generation does "
"not read books or newspapers unless they are online, the publishers of the "
"Liberty Tree are planning to cease the newsprint version of the paper by "
"2010. Readers will still be able to read their news stories online via "
"wireless mobile devices and high-speed internet connections and blog and "
"call each other names and be assholes on message boards. \"This really is "
"the future. It's 2.0. It's interactive. Paper books and newsprint will be "
"phased out by the end of the decade. Ebooks and web news are the future. Now "

"社计划在2010年前停止发行纸质版报纸。读者获取新闻消息的途径还有很多，比如无线移动设备、高速互联网、公开博客、激情对骂、论坛钓鱼。「这就是未来，这就是2"
".0时代，未来将充满交互。纸质的书籍和报纸会在21世纪的第一个十年后渐渐消失。电子书和在线新闻才是未来。我要去参加在线会议了，恕我失陪。」 "
"副出版人Louis Fertinatta在他的新博客上如是写道，而他开始写博客只是因为市场部的某个22岁混蛋告诉他：「这对未来至关重要。」天哪。"
