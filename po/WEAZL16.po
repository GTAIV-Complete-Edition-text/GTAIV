"The secular progressive loons are out in force this week, complaining about "
"an alleged \"gay basher\" in Middle Park. When a couple of heterosexual men "
"are beaten, there is no outcry. Should we bring up the sexuality, gender, "
"race, and religion of each beating victim in this city and go on an "
"appropriate witch-hunt afterwards? It's ridiculous. Crime is crime no matter "
"who the victim is or who the perpetrator is. Protecting minorities and so-"
"called special interest groups is exactly the kind of liberal nonsense that "
"has weakened this country and made us a target to homicidal maniacs from "
"around the world."

"army defending freedom are able to sleep in the same room? What will America "
"do when its moral fiber and leader of all that is dignified in the world "
"collapse in an avalanche of sodomy? It is not natural, and things that are "
"not natural should be abolished say many community leaders. Infertile "
"couples should be put to death. Marriage is sacred. So sacred that you can "
"get married for $99 in Las Venturas and divorced for $199 when you return "

"一旦自由派的主张最终获胜，几个男人共眠一室的场景就会在捍卫自由的军队之外上演，这是哪门子的未来啊？面对鸡奸的浪潮，美国的道德标准会土崩瓦解，美国将何去何从"
"？许多社区领袖都同意：鸡奸不合乎人的本性，而一切不合乎本性的事物都应当被禁止。没有生育能力的夫妻就应该被处死。婚姻是神圣的。神圣到你可以在Las "
