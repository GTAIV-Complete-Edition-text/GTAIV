"Liberty City's Deputy Police Commissioner, Francis McReary, was ruthlessly "
"gunned down earlier. To most of us he is a hero, a man dedicated to serving "
"the city who was taken before his time. Liberal \"Blame America First\" news "
"outlets have been sullying the man's reputation. Rather than celebrate this "
"patriot's great career, they dig up some unsubstantiated accusations of "
"corruption. Francis McReary valiantly served Liberty City until he was "
"murdered. We should remember him as an American Hero."

"自由城的警局副局长Francis McReary于早些时候惨遭枪杀。对于我们大多数人来说，他是英雄，是一个为自由城勤恳奉献的人，但他却英年早逝。那些「凡事"
"都怪美国」的自由派媒体一直在抹黑他，他们不去称赞这位爱国英雄的丰功伟绩，却在宣传无凭无据的贪污指控。Francis "
"McReary为自由城鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已，我们应当把他当作美国英雄纪念。"
