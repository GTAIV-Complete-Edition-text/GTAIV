"There has been yet another mass shooting in Alderney. Again it involved "
"members of the Pavano crime family and again the National Office of Security "
"Enforcement is calling it an act of terror. Whether this is an act against "
"AutoEroticar, the retailer where the shooting took place, or the mobsters "
"who were slaughtered, N.O.O.S.E would not say. However, they have stated "
"that several suspects have been airlifted from Liberty City to an offshore "
"questioning centre. These massacres have changed the spirit of Alderney "
"forever. No more will that patch of land on the other side of the West River "
"be associated with good working-class values, polluted swamps, spray-on "
"tans, big hair, violent racist masculinity and other American-as-apple-pie "
"attitudes of the suburbs. Maybe it's time to think about blocking the Booth "

"Fears over the safety of air travel were further compounded yesterday when a "
"drunken pilot nearly killed 200 passengers on an Air Sol flight from Vice "
"City to Francis International airport. Suspicions as to the pilot's state of "
"mind had been raised even before take-off when he welcomed passengers "
"\"aboard the party bus\" and announced that, \"in the unlikely event of "
"landing on water, the woman in 15B has two beautiful flotation devices.\" "
"Over the course of the 2-hour flight, he became audibly more boisterous and "
"incoherent singing, \"Who wants to sit on the captain's knee?\" and shouting "
"things like \"Kamikaze\" and \"Look no hands\" as the plane came into land. "
"\"He even asked an air hostess for a sickbag at one point,\" said one "
"terrified passenger. The 48-year-old father of two was questioned by Francis "
"International authorities before driving home."

"In the old days it was the Pavanos vs. The Gambettis or the Ancelottis vs. "
"the Lupicellas in a bloody war for control of various rackets within the "
"city. Now it's all happening again. This time it is thought to also include "
"mobsters from Alderney, who have broken away from the five families and are "
"seeking political parity with them. Who knew mobsters were such social "
"climbers? Well, crime expert Jimmy Cast for starters. He told us, \"Mobsters "
"are all vain - this war is not only a war for financial power, it is also a "
"war for social control over the city. Expect more bodies to turn up before "
"things calm down. The Alderney mob are known to be lawless and I imagine the "
"older families will also be nervous as the DA's office uses this as an "
"opportunity to indict several mobsters across the city in another massive "
"crackdown on organized crime.\" Mayor Ochoa said, \"We are close to "
"eradicating this menace once and for all. From now on, only big businesses "
"and the government should rob our people.\""
