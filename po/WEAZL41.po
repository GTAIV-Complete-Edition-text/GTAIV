"Since we were stupid enough to reopen the bridges around the metropolitan "
"area, traffic has got much worse. At the same time, terrorists are now "
"running wild about the city, in incredible numbers, we imagine. Next time "
"you are on a bridge, look around you. Those other cars are full of "
"terrorists, trying to blow up our freedom."

"Well, beat them to it. Restrict your own freedom and help the environment, "
"if you care about that sort of nonsense - support the proposals to shut the "
"bridges permanently. These radical ideas were suggested by Martin Hawes, a "
"man so freethinking the liberals locked him up. We say close the lunatic "
"asylums. Turn them into detention centers for undesirables of a different "
"sort, and close the bridges now."
msgstr ""
"那就抢占先机吧。要是你在乎那些胡说八道的话，限制你自己的自由然后保护环境——拥护永久关闭大桥的议案吧。这些激进的想法是由Martin "
"Hawes提出的，他的思想太过自由，以至于自由派把他关了起来。我们提议关闭疯人院，改造成看守所关押各种不良分子，然后立刻封锁大桥。"
