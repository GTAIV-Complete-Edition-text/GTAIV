"When customers arrived at the Triangle Strip Club in Bohan they were hoping "
"to see some flesh - but not this much. After a violent shootout, many "
"bodies, chunks of meat, and viscera were strewn around this gaudy exotic "
"dance venue. Amongst the dead are the brothers who ran the club, Javier, "
"Jesus and Jose Trunchez. The three were known associates of criminals "
"including the recently released crack kingpin Dwayne Forge. Police say the "
"shootout was not the result of a drug deal gone bad but rather a "
"dissatisfied customer. The killer is said to be a male with a European "
"accent. Other strip clubs such as the known mob hangout Honkers in Alderney "
"have increased their security."

"。警方称，此次枪击并非毒品交易失败引起，而是因一位顾客的不满。据称，凶手是一名欧洲口音的男性。位于Alderney的Honkers俱乐部等脱衣舞俱乐部已经"

"Remember the Platypus? It is the container ship that docked in Liberty City "
"and whose crew all promptly disappeared. The captain, as you may remember, "
"was found floating in the harbor, and the rest of the crew vanished into "
"thin air. One of the crew members has surfaced - dead. From too much "
"sadomasochism, it seems. Dave Bosoy was found in Algonquin last night, "
"trussed up in a straight jacket and diaper, covered in whip lashings. Police "

"还记得Platypus号吗？这是一艘停靠在自由城的集装箱货轮，所有船员离奇失踪。你可能还记得，先前有人在港口发现了船长的浮尸，而其他船员都消失得无影无踪。"
"昨晚其中一名船员浮出了水面——已经死亡。其死因似乎是过度的SM行为。Dave "
"Bosoy的尸体在Algonquin被发现，身穿拘束衣和纸尿布，皮肤上有多处遭受鞭打的痕迹。警方已经排除了蓄意谋杀的可能性。"
