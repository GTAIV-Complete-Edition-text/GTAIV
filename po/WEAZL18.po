"Committed family man and public servant, Bryce Dawkins, is the kind of man "
"who spreads fear into our enemies and shows why this IS the greatest country "
"the world has ever seen. Why? Because he says it how he sees it, not how "
"some liberal drug-addled elite want him to say it. He spoke out yesterday "
"over exactly the kind of thing that gives our enemies strength, and weakens "
"our ability to respond when the unthinkable happens (for those who don't "
"know and have been living under a rock these past 6 years, the unthinkable "
"is obvious - foreigners trying to kill us before we kill them)."

"而不是复读染有毒瘾的自由派精英写好的台本。昨天他明确指出是什么给了我们的敌人力量，削弱了我们应对匪夷所思状况的能力。(给消息不灵通和看不懂的读者的注释，匪"

"It's the taboo subject no one had thought of: Gays in the Fire Department. "
"It's not a subject most people had worried about, but, according to Mr. "
"Dawkins, the communal showers at most fire stations make men feel awkward. "
"\"Updating the showers to something where people can't openly stare "
"longingly at each other's genitals would cost money and it's money I'd "
"rather spend on protecting our city from terrorism,\" he said patriotically. "
"And so say all of us. Thank you, Mr. Dawkins, for keeping it real."

"这是一个没人想过的禁忌话题：消防队有基佬。大多数人不会考虑这一问题，但据Dawkins先生所说，多数消防站采用的开放式公共浴室会让男人感到尴尬。他爱国地说"
"：「如果要改造浴室，让使用者不能大大方方地眼馋别人的生殖器的话，改造所需的开销会很大，而我更愿意将这笔钱用于保护我们城市不受恐怖袭击。」我们深表同感。谢谢"
"你，Dawkins先生，谢谢你能保持真诚。"
