"Enforcement increased the terror threat level in Liberty City to a new "
"height. N.O.O.S.E has created the Charcoal 8 Level in order to bridge the "
"gap between the Red High 7 risk level and Black Severe 9. At Charcoal 8, "
"citizens should be wary of the new forms of attack becoming open to the "

"How can we expect to compete in the global marketplace if our unions are run "
"by thugs brandishing weapons and making unreasonable demands for minimum "

"如果工会的组织者都是「舞刀弄枪」的残暴歹徒，一边还要求不可理喻的最低工资和医疗保险，我们怎么可能在全球市场中赢得竞争呢？要想让本市的工商活动公平进行，唯一"

"Not content with killing off the entrepreneurial spirit, some unions have "
"taken to violence. The recent bloodbath on Yusuf Amir's construction site in "
"Castle Gardens can only be attributed to one thing - the endemic corruption "
"in construction unions in the Liberty City area. The so-called victims of "
"this massacre were carrying semi-automatic weapons! This writer doesn't want "
"to disrespect the dead, but I suspect the only time that these mob "
"associates handled concrete was when they coated a victim's feet in it and "
"dropped him into the Humboldt River. These mobsters were attempting to "
"defraud a foreign business man and they were a disgrace to this great "
"country."

"光是扼杀企业家精神还不够，一些工会竟然采取暴力手段。日前，Castle Gardens区Yusuf Amir名下的建筑工地发生了一起惨案，其原因只有一个—"

"触水泥。这帮黑社会想要敲诈外国商人，他们是我们伟大国家的奇耻大辱。"
