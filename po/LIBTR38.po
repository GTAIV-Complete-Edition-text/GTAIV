"Terrorists have struck again! Police responded to reports of gunfire at the "
"old oil refinery in the Acter Industrial Park in Alderney and found the "
"bodies of several men. Most of the men were identified as known associates "
"of the Pavano crime family along with Pete Marchetti and Marco Bonnaro, both "
"from Alderney. A N.O.O.S.E spokeman said that they are treating this as an "
"act of terrorism and do not see any significant organized crime link, \"The "
"Acter Industrial Park is full of sensitive equipment and volatile chemicals. "
"The terrorists were probably scouting for a target when they ran into these "
"mobsters, a gunfight ensued and the terrorists fled the scene. A mobster is "
"a patriot just like every other American; they were doing a duty for their "
"country.\" Witnesses saw several cars fleeing the scene. One of them carried "
"an injured person in the backseat. One man clearly had a foreign accent."
