"As if Middle Park was not dangerous enough, a suspected gay basher is on the "

"Dawkins认为这种过分的殴打系家庭观念缺失所致。他说：「同性恋不应该在在公园里招摇，小孩子看了很容易学坏的，而且还有可能被我看见。」"

"所以，只要你的车被Brucie调教过，你就能横扫千军。当然，在起跑线碰见Brucie本人的话算你倒霉。」当被问及他是否愿意为无脑赛车给自由城居民带来的风险"
"背书时，Kibbutz先生拒绝了继续接受采访，变得十分愤怒，用头反复撞击自家车库的墙。难道非要等到某个视力受损的老妇人被Brucie "
"Kibbutz这样的睾酮旺盛的改车狂撞倒，这种危险而不负责的街头赛车才会受到管控吗？希望不会如此，Ochoa市长。"
