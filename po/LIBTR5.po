"Today, members of the media and activist groups had mixed reactions to "
"Liberty City's Police Commissioner for Public Affairs Tom Pireni's "
"presentation on police brutality. The \"Wing It\" slideshow presentation was "
"given to the media today, arguing that the \"Broker Bridge Incident\" is not "
"considered police brutality. After a bizarre musical performance, many "
"residents were not convinced. Several residents have filed formal complaints "
"after footage today showing several women and children being thrown off the "
"bridge by police. Police argue that the footage does not tell the real story."

"今天，LCPD公共事务处处长Tom Pireni就警察暴力执法发表演讲，媒体人员和维权组织对此反应不一。他在题为「随机应变」的演讲中表示，「Broker桥"
"事件」未非警察暴力执法。在一段莫名其妙的音乐演出之后，许多市民对此仍难以信服。观看了今天几名妇女儿童被扔下桥的录像后，一些市民正式起诉警方。警方则称那段录"
"像未能反映客观事实。"

"Police say after an anonymous tip from an elderly resident in the Steinway "
"section of the city that law enforcement officers discovered three suspects "
"in a portable methamphetamine lab. Liberty City Police, N.O.O.S.E agents and "
"Bureau of Narcotics officials did not release the names of the suspects but "
"indicated meth is a serious problem in Liberty City. \"Meth has destroyed "
"the lives and businesses of cocaine dealers in Vice City, and we see the "
"same happening here,\" said agent Albert Thomas. Thomas would not indicate "
"what made the elderly resident call in the tip but said that the woman "
"smelled like an old person and reminded him of when his grandmother showed "
"him her junk."

"警方表示，在得到一位老人的匿名举报后，执法人员在Steinway区的可移动冰毒实验室里发现了三名嫌疑人。LCPD、国安办探员和麻醉药物管理局的官员都未给出"
"三名嫌疑人的具体信息，但他们指出：自由城的冰毒问题十分严重。探员Albert Thomas说：「冰毒毁掉了罪城可卡因商人的生计，而同样的事也发生在这里。」"
"该探员不愿透漏老人决定举报的原因，但他说那个散发着老人臭的女人让他想起了他的祖母给他看她的下体时的场景。"
