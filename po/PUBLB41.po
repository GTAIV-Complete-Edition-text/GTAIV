"The racists and snobs who run Liberty City once sacked Martin Hawes because "
"he was clinically insane and wore a bra to work. Now, they are discussing an "
"idea he came up with from his lunatic asylum bed. Why? Because, if the idea "
"helps them make more money, they don't care where it comes from. And his "
"idea? Re-close the bridges and tunnels. The reason? To ease traffic and keep "
"the poor out. Only those who could afford speedboats would be able to "
"function normally in the city. It is the proposal of a lunatic. It would "
"keep the rich in, and the poor out. No wonder it is an idea people are "
"actually discussing."

"。为什么？因为，只要这个想法能赚钱，他们就不在乎它是哪儿来的。至于是什么想法？再次关闭大桥和隧道。至于理由？减轻交通压力，与穷人进行隔离。只有那些买得起快"
"艇的人才能在城里正常生活。这就是精神病人出的主意。它会在贫富之间划清界限。也难怪人们都会讨论这个想法。"
