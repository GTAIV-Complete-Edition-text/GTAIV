"This change in strategy makes the already fraught task of naming the serial "
"killer much more difficult. Police are baffled about this dangerous turn of "
"events, while the city lives in dread. One Dukes resident noted, \"What does "
"it say about our police department that they can't even name a serial "
"killer? What must the Midwest think of us now? It's pathetic. The police "
"chief should be beheaded, never mind these poor victims.\""

"到底有什么用？这下我们要被中西部的人当什么了？真是可悲。警局局长就该被斩首，他根本不在乎可怜的受害者。」"
