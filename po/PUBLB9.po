"Racial profiling. Shootouts at southern border checkpoints. Skyrocketing "
"tequila prices. The bloody side effects of the recent legislation pushed "
"through by Border Agents Love Land Security are very clear. A group of "
"wealthy civil liberties donors gathered recently in downtown Liberty City to "
"discuss the problem. \"People from other countries are simple, and as rich "
"white liberals we must coddle them, treat them like babies, nurture them, "
"patronize them. Not everyone is as sophisticated and well-educated as us, "

"We appear to have elected a fascist into City Hall. Worse, we have elected "
"an idiot. Even worse, they are the same man. Deputy Mayor, Bryce Dawkins, "
"made comments that would make your average village idiot blush when he "
"attempted to link gay rights to global terrorism, economic collapse and "
"America's supposed imminent downfall. His subsequent attempts to deflect the "
"criticism show what an awful and pathetic little toad he really is. So the "
"question is; how did this man get into a position of power? And the answer, "
"of course, is big business."

"Contacts who now ensure the city is run to support the rich and keep money "
