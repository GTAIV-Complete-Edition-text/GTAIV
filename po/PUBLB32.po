"The Deputy Police Commissioner for Liberty City, Francis McReary, was gunned "
"down in Algonquin earlier. Some were shocked that a member of the LCPD would "
"be the victim of a gangland execution, but not those that knew what he was "
"really like. McReary's own brother, a known associate of the Alderney mob, "
"was recently arrested on racketeering charges. This news organization was "
"approached by two independent sources wishing to expose photographic "
"evidence of Francis McReary's taking bribes. Soon after they made contact, "
"however, both men were mysteriously murdered. One of these men was lawyer "
"Tom Goldberg."

"justice into his own hands in order to get his department's case clearance "
"level up. In the weeks leading up to his death, this website had been "
"attempting to get a comment from McReary on all of these accusations. He did "
"not respond to our requests. Now, it seems, he will take the secrets of his "
"corrupt reign of terror to his grave."
