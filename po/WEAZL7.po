"It's the news our enemies love - the terrible price of freedom - the "
"catastrophe of the falling stock market. The BAWSAQ has been in freefall the "
"last few days, and it's the kind of news that makes terrorists rejoice and "
"liberals wonder how they can interfere to bring prices down further. It's a "
"natural consequence of years of over-regulation, big government and the "
"killing of the entrepreneurial spirit that made this country the envy of "
"foreigners everywhere. The country will enter a serious recession and be "
"governed by a combination of Islamic terrorists, homosexuals and communists "
"unless action is taken immediately - the government must cut the highest "
"rate of income tax for the rich, abolish capital gains tax and liberate the "
"rich to make investments wherever they see fit."

"As terrorists try to blow up our way of life and our Rusty Brown's stores, "
"Congress took the courageous move today and passed the Jingoism Act, "
"bringing back some much needed sanity into a country that has lost its way. "
"Family values will be mandatory under the new law, and sodomy has been "
"outlawed completely except in rare cases. Citizens are required to submit "
"their email passwords to their local police to assist in tracking down those "
"who would do harm to our country. Since the liberals desperately want the "
"terrorists to win, this is a goose step in the right direction."

"鉴于恐怖分子想要破坏我们的生活和Rusty Brown甜品店，国会今天迈出了极具魄力的一步——通过沙文主义法案，这将给我们迷途的国家带回些许亟需的理智。新"
