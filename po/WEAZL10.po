"But leftist loons have opened the borders to evil people hell bent on the "
"destruction of our freedom. Everyday we allow foreign nationals to enter "
"this country. They steal American jobs, they seduce American women, soon "
"enough they will bomb American subways. The only answer is to take these "
"leftwing loons, obsessed with political correctness, out of office. I'm "
"talking about people like Jacquise Benson, Doris Fung, and Mary Mayfly - "
"liberals in City Hall who care more about the freedom of terrorists than the "
"freedom of American citizens."

"但左派的蠢驴已让国门洞开，让那些恶鬼得以肆意践踏我们的自由。我们每天都放行外国人进入本国，他们窃取美国人的工作，糟蹋美国人的姑娘，早晚还要炸了美国人的地铁"
"。解决这些问题的唯一方法，就是让那些天天搞政治正确的左驴下台。说的就是Jacquie Benson、Doris Fung和Mary "
"Mayfly，比起美国公民的自由，这几个市政厅里的自由派居然更在乎恐怖分子的自由。"

"The terror threat level in Liberty City has stayed at Magenta 5 for the last "
"year. Liberty City is the jewel in the crown of the United States of "
"America. It is a country that is indisputably the only world power and "
"should fear no one. Why is it that citizens of this great country are scared "
"of the violent actions of a marginalized group? People in Algonquin, Broker, "
"Bohan, Dukes and Alderney are justifiably scared of a horrific act of "
"terrorism because this country has not put the correct measures in place to "
"protect itself. Americans have a constitutional right to be protected from "
"foreigners."

"去年以来，自由城的恐怖威胁等级一直是紫红色级(5级)。自由城是美利坚合众国皇冠上的明珠，而美国毫无疑问是无所畏惧的世界霸权。但为什么，生活在这般伟大国家的"
"国民，还会被边缘小团体的暴行给吓倒呢？全都因为这个国家未能及时采取措施自保，居住在Algonquin、Broker、Bohan、Dukes和Alderne"
"y的人们才会理所当然地害怕恐怖主义行径。宪法可是赋予了美国人不被外国人侵犯的权利的。"

"Just imagine - it's 98 degrees outside and you have to walk to work. No air-"
"conditioned comfortable SUV to sit in traffic in. No listening to your "
"favorite WKTT radio shows in the morning commute. Or worse yet, sitting on a "
"smelly train with no-manners immigrants shoving curry in their faces and "
"clipping their toenails while they mutter \"death to America.\" This is the "
"future the liberals have planned if new global warming legislation is "
"passed. While the rest of the first world may have bought science's lies, we "
"haven't. Call your congressman and tell him (or if you are really "
"unfortunate, her) to stop listening to scientists with an agenda. Let's keep "
"America moving forward."

"想象一下——室外37度，你还得走路去上班。没有机会坐在舒适的SUV里吹着空调等堵车，没有机会听你上早班时最爱听的WKTT电台。更糟的是，你要坐在臭气冲天的"
"地铁上，和一群没素质的挖脸抠脚移民挤在一起，听他们叨叨「天诛美国」。一旦自由派新起草的全球变暖应对法案通过，这就是我们的未来。或许其他第一世界国家都听信了"
"科学家的谎言，但我们还没有。赶紧打电话找你所在选区的众议员，告诉他(女议员也凑合着说吧)别听那些别有用心的科学家的鬼话了。让我们一起为美国助力前行。"
