"The Deputy Police Commissioner for Liberty City, Francis McReary, stood by "
"while his brother Derrick was shot in Algonquin earlier. Some were shocked "
"that a brother of a senior member of the LCPD would be the victim of a "
"gangland execution, but not those that knew what the McReary family is "
"really like. Derrick McReary, 52, had recently returned to the US from "
"Ireland and was himself caught up in organized crime. Some believe he may "
"have been trying to blackmail the Deputy Commissioner who himself saw his "
"brother as a liability. Another brother, Gerald McReary, a known associate "
"of the Alderney mob, was recently arrested on racketeering charges."

"早些时候，自由城警察局副局长Francis McReary于他的兄弟Derrick在Algonquin被枪杀时袖手旁观。有些人对一名LCPD高级警员的兄弟"
"，会成为黑社会私刑的受害者感到震惊。但那些了解McReary家族真实情况的人不这么认为。52岁的Derrick "
"McReary最近刚从爱尔兰回到美国，他本人也卷入了有组织犯罪。有人认为，他可能一直在试图敲诈副局长，而副局长本人也将他的兄弟视作累赘。他的另一个兄弟，"
"Gerald McReary，是Alderney黑帮的知名同伙，近因涉黑指控被捕。"

"This news organization was approached by two independent sources wishing to "
"expose photographic evidence of Francis McReary's taking bribes. Soon after "
"they made contact, however, both men were mysteriously murdered. One of "
"these men was lawyer Tom Goldberg. Sources within the LCPD have alleged that "
"McReary was willing to take justice into his own hands in order to get his "
"department's case clearance level up. In the weeks leading up to his "
"brother's death, this website had been attempting to get a comment from "
"McReary on all of these accusations. He has so far not responded to our "
"requests."

"曾有两名独立消息人士联系本站，表示希望披露Francis McReary受贿的照片证据。然而，在他们进行联系后不久，这两人都离奇遇害。其中一人正是Tom "
"Goldberg律师。LCPD内部人士声称McReary本想采取一切手段提高其部门的结案率。在其兄弟死前几周，本站一直尝试从McReary口中取得其对这些"
"指控的看法，但其至今仍未对此做出回应。"
