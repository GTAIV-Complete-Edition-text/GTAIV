"I know I'm not being fair to you and that writing an email is the coward's "
"way out. If your feelings for me are anything like mine for you, then this "
"must be difficult to read. I have to look out for myself now and to do what "
"I think will be best for me in the long time. Things have been hard recently "
"- seeing a brother die and one get locked up. I kind of think that Packie is "

"我不是要为此惩罚你。你不可能改变自己的生活或是为人，我也不能期待你改变它们。祝你生活顺利，Niko。希望你能找到幸福。"
