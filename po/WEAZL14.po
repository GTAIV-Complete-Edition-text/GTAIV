"In a statement issued today, Mayor Julio Ochoa suggested that he is "
"considering succumbing to public pressure to reopen the bridges separating "
"the Eastern Boroughs from Algonquin, despite the ongoing threat of "
"terrorism. Commuter groups and government agencies are at war over the "
"matter. Officials contend that anything that could be a target should be "
"shut down by martial law. Mayor Ochoa has suggested the possibility of these "
"bridges reopening despite the inevitable bloody consequences. Is this a fair "
"price to pay for increased convenience?"

"online dating sites and make people learn proper social skills and proper "
"manners. This is a war America, and it's a war I intend to win. It's a war "
