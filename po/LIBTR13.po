"Recently, Billy Grey, leader of the Alderney chapter of The Lost biker gang, "
"was released from a rehabilitation center. Members of the community were "
"shocked that Mr. Grey got off with such a light sentence after his crimes "
"and that he is now back on the street. During his period inside, biker crime "
"in Liberty City had dwindled to almost nothing. However, in recent days, new "
"skirmishes have broken out making police think that old scores are being "
"settled. Reports have come in of shootouts and bike chases through the "
"metropolitan area. The bodies of several suspected members of both The Lost "
"and their arch rivals the Angels of Death have been recovered."

"近日，失落摩托帮Alderney分部的首领Billy Grey从戒毒所被释放。Grey先生案底累累，竟然只是被判强制戒毒，现已重获自由，当地居民对此十分震"
"惊。在其服刑期间，自由城的飞车党犯罪基本销声匿迹。不过，今日又有几场小规模冲突爆发，警方认为这是在清算旧账。大都会地区已接到多起枪战和机车追逐的报告。同时"
"还发现了多具尸体，疑为失落帮及其敌对帮派死亡天使的成员。"

"Was Judge Barry Griffin's sentence too lenient for this hardened drug "
"trafficker? If anyone deserved to be put into a maximum security "
"correctional facility, it was Billy Grey. His sentencing to a country club "
"rehabilitation center is an insult to all of us on the side of law and order."

"Barry Griffin法官对这个贩毒惯犯的判决是否过轻？Billy "
"Grey这种人就该关进最高安保级别的监狱。判他去乡下戒毒所完全是对我们这些遵纪守法好公民的侮辱。"
