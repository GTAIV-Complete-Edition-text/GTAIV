"The music was powerful, the conversations were earnest and the sex was mind-"
"blowing. It seemed like the party was never going to end. Then it did. You "
"got a bit fat around the middle. You began having serious conversations "
"about mortgages. Ravers and party goers emerged from the best decade of "
"their lives only to be hit with the grim reality that they were going to pay "
"the price for all that fun. Ten years later, people are starting to worry "
"when all the devastating long-term effects are going to kick in. The answer "
"is any minute. \"Every time I get a cold or forget my keys, I am convinced "
"that it's the beginning of the end; that I'm going to be found rocking in "
"darkened room in a state of permanent catatonia from all that LSD, Ecstasy "
"and weed I did,\" said James, a 33-year-old lawyer from Algonquin, \"If it "
"doesn't happen soon, I'm going to dust off the white gloves and glow sticks "
"and get back out there.\""

"The tragic death of Charles Pathmanson became even more tragic as "
"investigators say a tragic tale of tragedy is unfolding in the tragic emails "

"oven at 500 degrees in the middle of the night, fatally breaking the ice "
"machine, and continually making the toaster pop up and down. In an act of "
"desperation, Pathmanson attempted to install a firewall and new motherboard "
"in the toaster, at which point hackers switched it on and electrocuted him. "
"Police are trolling online games and \"asking these snotfaced little "
"egomaniacal griefers if they know anything about it,\" Police investigator "

"Charles Pathmanson的悲惨死亡比想象中还要悲惨。调查人员表示，在他的悲惨惨剧发生的前一天，悲剧的他收到了一封悲剧的邮件，邮件中写着一个悲剧"
"的悲惨故事。Pathmanson是「未来厨房」项目的设计师，他的电器长期被黑客入侵、开开关关，他的制冰机也被黑客远程破坏，面包机中的面包也被反复弹出。而他"
"也一直在与黑客对抗。当时Pathmanson正在给面包机安装防火墙、替换主板，这时黑客启动了面包机，致其触电身亡。目前警方正在网络游戏中进行调查，"
"据警探Mike Loretti所说，他们同时也在「询问那些自私自利的自大狂是否知晓相关情况」。"
