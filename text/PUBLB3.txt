;0x08624699=A blast from the past today as former talk show host Lazlow is trying to get back on the airwaves. Lazlow used to host a popular show on a station called Chatterbox at the turn of the millennium, then things turned bad for him and he disappeared from our airwaves after a string of personal humiliations and bad choices, including several payola scandals, and a series of sexual shenanigans led to major credibility issues. But it appears he is back. Or trying to get back. He's been trying to raise financing for a new radio station to be launched in Liberty City in which the listener is put right into the action. 
0x08624699=爆炸性新闻，前脱口秀主持人Lazlow竟想重回电台。21 世纪初时，Lazlow曾在Chatterbox电台主持一档热门节目，后来情况一落千丈。先是被曝数次受贿放歌，而后是种种性骚扰丑闻，让他的形象完全崩塌。不过他似乎又回来了，或者是想回来了。他一直在努力筹资，以在自由城成立一家听众导向的新电台。

;0xBA46AA63=Announcing his plans at a poorly-attended press conference yesterday, he said, "This is radio 2.0, this is Lazlow 2.0, I'm back." When asked to explain what on earth this could mean, the popular shock jock said, "I don't really know - it's up to you, the listeners, to decide.' We will stay on this story in the hope this guy makes something of himself. 
0xBA46AA63=昨天，他在门庭冷清的记者招待会上公布了他的计划，他说：「这就是电台 2.0，这就是Lazlow 2.0，我回来了。」当被问及所谓2.0究竟有何区别时，这名人气DJ回答道：「我也不清楚。主要还是看你们——听众们——的意见。」我们会持续跟进此事，希望他能有所成就。
