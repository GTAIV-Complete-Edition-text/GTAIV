Just like I don't want to get on a plane with a female pilot, I don't want some chick messing around with my source code. We deliberately create ugly interfaces and make it as hard as possible to install programs in order to discourage women. First they start drinking beer and now this. Is nothing sacred any more? What next, a female president? I've tried speaking to girls in real life but all they do is laugh at me. I hope her kernel explodes.\" Many are already drawing parallels between this story and the female plumber who was run out of a San Andreas town last year.",

Mr. Gravelli, 85, had been residing at the Schottler Medical Center for the last 3 years. Although some in the DA's office argued that this was a ruse to avoid a court case, Mr. Gravelli never left hospital after being admitted. Mr. Gravelli has been head of the Gambetti crime syndicate since 1978 and under his stewardship, the family had become the most powerful of Liberty City's crime families, rivaling the Pavano family. Although he had been indicted several times, Mr. Gravelli was never convicted of a serious crime. Some believed he had contacts within the government who protected him, and for whom he would get criminal associates to perform hits and other crimes, but these allegations were never substantiated. What happens now to the delicate balance of power amongst criminal gangs within Liberty City is unknown. It is unlikely to be pretty.",
