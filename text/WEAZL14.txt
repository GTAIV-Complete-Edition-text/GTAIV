;0x03922A0C=In a statement issued today, Mayor Julio Ochoa suggested that he is considering succumbing to public pressure to reopen the bridges separating the Eastern Boroughs from Algonquin, despite the ongoing threat of terrorism. Commuter groups and government agencies are at war over the matter. Officials contend that anything that could be a target should be shut down by martial law. Mayor Ochoa has suggested the possibility of these bridges reopening despite the inevitable bloody consequences. Is this a fair price to pay for increased convenience?
0x03922A0C=在今天发表的声明中，市长Julio Ochoa表示即使恐怖主义盛行的威胁依然存在，他仍在考虑屈服于民意，恢复由Algonquin通往Eastern Boroughs的大桥的通行。通勤族与政府为此事争论不休。市府官员认为任何可能被当作袭击目标的地点都应下达通行禁令。市长Ochoa置几乎必然的流血事件于不顾，表示大桥有重新通行的可能性。为了交通便利付出如此代价是值得吗？

;0x060958F9=The link between depression and terrorism is well known, with most terrorists also being depressives and vice versa. It's a natural consequence of the liberal hegemony and the decline in civil society since the 60s 'me' generation ruined our society and gave our enemies hope. Hope that I would crush out of them with a bomb, just as I would bomb all of those awful online dating sites and make people learn proper social skills and proper manners. This is a war America, and it's a war I intend to win. It's a war on cowardice, and it will be the subject of my next book.
0x060958F9=许多恐怖分子罹患抑郁症，反之亦然，抑郁症和恐怖主义之间的连结是可想而知的。60年代以来，“自私的一代”让我们的社会陷入绝望，给敌人带来希望，这是自由主义霸权与公民社会的衰落的必然结果。我真希望能把他们都炸成碎片，就像我要炸飞所有该死的约会网站一样，人们才能学习到货真价实的社交礼仪。这是一场战争，美利坚，我们必须赢下这场战争。这是勇敢与懦弱之间的战争，我将在下一本书好好谈论它。

;0x786E47EB=I've written recently about the potential link between online dating and terrorism. Now sociologists warn of a new danger - depression. Apparently desperados cannot handle it when they discover the person they met at <a href="www.love-meet.net">love-meet.net</a> lied about themselves in order to hoodwink the unsuspecting into a date. What a surprise? Lie online? Who would have thought of that? I never have, because I'm a conservative and we don't lie, but I know most people do.
0x786E47EB=最近我写了一篇关于网络交友和恐怖主义之间潜在联系的文章。社会学家现在注意到一个新的威胁——抑郁症。很显然，如果亡命之徒发现他们在<a href="www.love-meet.net">love-meet.net</a> 约会的对象无时无刻不在撒谎，欺骗着毫无防备的他们，是无法控制住自己的。线上惊喜？线下惊吓？谁会在乎呢？假作真时真亦假，无为有处有还无！我从来不在乎真假，因为我是一个保守主义者，我们不会欺骗，但我知道大部分人说谎成性。

;0xEF6501B2=Weazel News doesn't think so. If he is foolish enough to open the bridges, he and the President should put out a very clear ultimatum. If Liberty City is attacked again, the United States will respond in kind. We will start throwing darts at a map and bomb any country we hit, only stopping when we feel satisfied. Arbitrary violence must be met with arbitrary violence.
0xEF6501B2=Weazel News不这么看。如果他蠢到开通大桥，他应该和总统一起发表一个非常明确的声明。如果Liberty City再被袭击，联邦政府将承担相应责任。用向地图投掷飞镖来决定要轰炸哪个国家，直到我们满意为止。 唯一值得暴力的就是暴力本身。
