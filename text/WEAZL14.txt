;0x03922A0C=In a statement issued today, Mayor Julio Ochoa suggested that he is considering succumbing to public pressure to reopen the bridges separating the Eastern Boroughs from Algonquin, despite the ongoing threat of terrorism. Commuter groups and government agencies are at war over the matter. Officials contend that anything that could be a target should be shut down by martial law. Mayor Ochoa has suggested the possibility of these bridges reopening despite the inevitable bloody consequences. Is this a fair price to pay for increased convenience?
0x03922A0C=在今天发表的声明中，Julio Ochoa市长表示尽管恐怖威胁依然存在，但他正考虑向民众的抗议压力低头，开放连接东部地区和Algonquin的几座大桥。通勤族和政府机构就此事争论已久。官员认为，任何可能成为袭击目标的地方都应当军管戒严。Ochoa市长提议开放桥梁，尽管这将带来无可避免的伤害性后果。为了换取交通便利，这种代价是否值得？

;0x060958F9=The link between depression and terrorism is well known, with most terrorists also being depressives and vice versa. It's a natural consequence of the liberal hegemony and the decline in civil society since the 60s 'me' generation ruined our society and gave our enemies hope. Hope that I would crush out of them with a bomb, just as I would bomb all of those awful online dating sites and make people learn proper social skills and proper manners. This is a war America, and it's a war I intend to win. It's a war on cowardice, and it will be the subject of my next book.
0x060958F9=抑郁症与恐怖主义之间的关系人尽皆知，绝大多数恐怖分子都有抑郁症，反之亦然。这是自由主义霸权和公民社会衰落的必然后果，都是因为60年代的「自我一代」毁坏了我们的社会，给了敌人希望。我真希望自己能用炸弹炸死这些人，我同样希望炸毁那些恶劣的约会网站，还要让人们学习合适的社交技巧与礼仪。这是一场战争，美国，这是一场我想要获胜的战争。这是一场对抗怯懦的战争，这也是我下一本书的主题。

;0x786E47EB=I've written recently about the potential link between online dating and terrorism. Now sociologists warn of a new danger - depression. Apparently desperados cannot handle it when they discover the person they met at <a href="www.love-meet.net">love-meet.net</a> lied about themselves in order to hoodwink the unsuspecting into a date. What a surprise? Lie online? Who would have thought of that? I never have, because I'm a conservative and we don't lie, but I know most people do.
0x786E47EB=最近我已经发表了一篇关于网络约会和恐怖主义之间的潜在联系的文章。现在社会学家又发现了新的威胁——抑郁症。在 <a href="www.love-meet.net">love-meet.net</a> 结交的网友编造了自己的现实情况，欺骗着毫无防备的对象，受骗的亡命徒们显然无法接受这一现实。真是新奇啊？线上惊喜？线下惊吓？这谁想得到啊？我是想不到，因为我是保守主义者，我们不说谎，但我知道大多数人会。

;0xEF6501B2=Weazel News doesn't think so. If he is foolish enough to open the bridges, he and the President should put out a very clear ultimatum. If Liberty City is attacked again, the United States will respond in kind. We will start throwing darts at a map and bomb any country we hit, only stopping when we feel satisfied. Arbitrary violence must be met with arbitrary violence.
0xEF6501B2=Weazel新闻的观点是不值得。如果他真的蠢到解封大桥，他和总统就应明确下达最后通牒。一旦自由城再次遇袭，美国将会对等还击。我们会朝地图投掷飞镖，扎到哪个国家就轰炸哪里，炸到我们满足为止。必须用无差别暴力对付无差别暴力。
