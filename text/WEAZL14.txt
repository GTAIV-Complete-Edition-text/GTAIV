;0x03922A0C=In a statement issued today, Mayor Julio Ochoa suggested that he is considering succumbing to public pressure to reopen the bridges separating the Eastern Boroughs from Algonquin, despite the ongoing threat of terrorism. Commuter groups and government agencies are at war over the matter. Officials contend that anything that could be a target should be shut down by martial law. Mayor Ochoa has suggested the possibility of these bridges reopening despite the inevitable bloody consequences. Is this a fair price to pay for increased convenience?
0x03922A0C=在今天发表的声明中，Julio Ochoa市长表示虽然恐怖分子仍在活动，他已经在考虑向公众屈服并重开由Algonquin通向Eastern Boroughs的大桥。 上班族和政府机构都在这件事上争论不休。官员们认为任何可能被攻击的地方都应当被禁令关闭。市长Ochoa表示虽然可能会引发流血事件，但这些大桥还是应当开放。为了交通便利而付出如此代价值得吗？

;0x060958F9=The link between depression and terrorism is well known, with most terrorists also being depressives and vice versa. It's a natural consequence of the liberal hegemony and the decline in civil society since the 60s 'me' generation ruined our society and gave our enemies hope. Hope that I would crush out of them with a bomb, just as I would bomb all of those awful online dating sites and make people learn proper social skills and proper manners. This is a war America, and it's a war I intend to win. It's a war on cowardice, and it will be the subject of my next book.
0x060958F9=抑郁症和恐怖主义之间的联系是可想而知的，大多数恐怖分子都有抑郁症，反之亦然。那是在自由主义霸权和公民社会的衰落之下的自然结果，自从60年代以来，「个人主义」的兴盛毁灭了我们的社会，给了敌人希望。我真希望能把他们都炸成碎片，就像我将要炸掉所有那些坏透的约炮网站，让人们学习真正的社交技巧与礼仪。这是一场战争，美国，我必胜。这是一场对抗怯懦的战争，它将是我下一本书的主题。

;0x786E47EB=I've written recently about the potential link between online dating and terrorism. Now sociologists warn of a new danger - depression. Apparently desperados cannot handle it when they discover the person they met at <a href="www.love-meet.net">love-meet.net</a> lied about themselves in order to hoodwink the unsuspecting into a date. What a surprise? Lie online? Who would have thought of that? I never have, because I'm a conservative and we don't lie, but I know most people do.
0x786E47EB=我最近写了一篇关于网络约会和恐怖主义之间潜在联系的文章。现在社会学家们注意到一个新的威胁——忧郁症。很显然那群亡命之徒发现人们通过<a href="www.love-meet.net">love-meet.net</a> 约会时都在撒谎，欺骗着毫无防备的对象。一个惊喜？还是谎言？谁会在乎呢？我从来没有，因为我是一个保守主义者，我们不会欺骗，但我知道大部分人会。

;0xEF6501B2=Weazel News doesn't think so. If he is foolish enough to open the bridges, he and the President should put out a very clear ultimatum. If Liberty City is attacked again, the United States will respond in kind. We will start throwing darts at a map and bomb any country we hit, only stopping when we feel satisfied. Arbitrary violence must be met with arbitrary violence.
0xEF6501B2=Weazel新闻不这么看。如果他蠢到开通大桥，他和总统应该发布一个非常明确的最后通碟。如果自由城再被袭击，美国将承担相应的责任。我们将开始向地图投掷飞镖并且随意轰炸任何国家，直到我们满意为止。 任何暴力都将面对同等的暴力。
