;0x598DB3BC=City officials gave no word as to when this siege on common sense will continue, but residents are urged to support liberal candidates in the next election so we can have our freedoms back, like the important freedom to ban smoking, profanity or anything that might upset people who recycle. 
0x598DB3BC=市政府官员没有透露这场对常识的围攻会持续多久，但是居民被怂恿在下一次选举中支持自由派候选人，这样我们就可以重获自由，比如禁止吸烟和脏话的重要自由，出台令垃圾分类践行者落泪的政策的重要自由。

;0x97622FA4=The so called "War on Terror" is now a war on commuters and the poor, who don't have helicopters but instead are forced to use trains, bridges and tunnels, many of which are closed after an unsubstantiated Internet threat. Rather than broker peace talks and work to end global warming, Liberty City politicians and federal agents are flush with anti-terror cash which they stuff down the panties of defense contractors to turn this city into a war zone. 
0x97622FA4=所谓的「反恐战争」却成为了一场针对通勤者和穷人的战争。他们没有直升机，只能选择城铁、桥梁和隧道，而未经证实的网络恐怖威胁封堵了他们仅剩的选择。自由城的政客和联邦探员并没有选择和平谈判，也没有尝试解决气候变暖，反倒将反恐资金塞进国防承包商的口袋，把本市变成了战区。
