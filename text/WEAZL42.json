He argued that 99% of the people who come into this country are honest (I'd like to see the statistics to back that one up, by the way) and believe in the same things that patriotic American citizens do. He then went on to say that, besides terrorism, the biggest threat to American safety at the moment is these gangsters coming into Liberty City from Russia and Eastern Europe and setting up shop in immigrant communities like Hove Beach.",
            "translated": "好吧，所以说Boddy Jefferson在市政厅发表的演说可谓是煞费苦心地赞美移民，同时也毫不留情地咒骂其他人。他认为，这个国家99%的外来者都是诚实的(顺便一提，我倒想瞧瞧支持这一观点的数据)，且与我们美国的爱国者信仰相同。他还强调，除了恐怖主义，目前对美国国民安全的最大威胁，就是自由城中来自俄国和东欧的黑帮歹徒，他们还在Hove Beach这样的移民社区里开张店铺。",

Also, learn our language, even if we haven't quite properly mastered it yet. They shouldn't go somewhere like Hove Beach which is more Russian than some parts of Moscow. If these guys are such a threat, then why don't we just close the borders to everyone? I say close the borders to these bastards. Remember, 9 in 10 terrorists are foreign too.",
