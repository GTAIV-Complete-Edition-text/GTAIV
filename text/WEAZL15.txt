;0x9BC14828=We all know that liberals love drugs. From Vinewood cocaine parties to ecstasy-fueled swinging suburban romps, to pre-schoolers having their drinks laced with acid and college kids shooting up heroin, nothing says 'liberal drop out' like a family ruined by the ravages of drugs. Now, police are saying there is an incontrovertible link between drugs coming into our city and our nation and the terror threat we all face. It's the thing liberals love most - the fact that their licentious behavior is putting the lives of all of us at deadly risk.
0x9BC14828=我们都知道自由主义者热爱毒品。从好麦坞的可卡因派对到充斥着摇头丸的郊区狂欢，从学龄前儿童喝迷幻药到大学生注射海洛因，没有什么比一个被毒品毁掉的家庭更能说明「自由主义的堕落」了。现在，警方称进入本市以及我国的毒品和我们面临的恐怖威胁之间存在不容置疑的联系。这正是自由派的最爱－用他们的肆意妄为把我们所有人的性命置于致命威胁之中。

;0x9CE90944=In a bow to terrorists, Mayor Ochoa shows classic liberal weakness by reopening the bridges between the outer boroughs and Algonquin. Does he not know we are at war and all need to make some sacrifices if our way of life and freedoms are to be protected? Apparently not. Now he's made life easy for both commuters and those who would do us harm. It's classic liberal wooly thinking. What's needed is a good simple conservative principle: punish everyone - then you know you'll get the bad guys. The Hickey Bridge and the Booth Tunnel remain closed.
0x9CE90944=Ochoa市长向恐怖分子低头，重新开放了连接外围城区和Algonquin的大桥，将他典型的自由派式软弱展露无遗。难道他不知道我们现在在战争当中吗？难道他不知道为了保护我们的生命与自由，这点牺牲是有必要的吗？他显然不知道。现在他确实带来了便利，通勤族和想要伤害我们的人都享受到了。这是自由派典型的浆糊脑瓜。现在我们只需要一条保守派的简单原则：全都受罚——这样一定能惩治坏人。Hickey大桥和Booth隧道仍处于关闭状态。

;0xAE00ECA7=Why? Because terrorists sell drugs to liberals to buy bombs to kill us all. It's really that simple. The police department said so yesterday and I for one believe them. Now that we finally have the truth, it isn't the military industrial complex that's the problem, so isn't it time that we punish drug addicts properly like the criminals they really are?
0xAE00ECA7=为什么？因为恐怖分子把毒品卖给了自由派，赚了钱后就买炸弹杀我们全家。就是这么简单。警方昨天也是这么说的，我相信他们。如今我们终于知道了真相，问题不在于军工复合体，现在不正是惩治那些吸毒者的时机吗？毕竟他们的本质就是罪犯。
