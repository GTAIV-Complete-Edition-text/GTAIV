;0x9BC14828=We all know that liberals love drugs. From Vinewood cocaine parties to ecstasy-fueled swinging suburban romps, to pre-schoolers having their drinks laced with acid and college kids shooting up heroin, nothing says 'liberal drop out' like a family ruined by the ravages of drugs. Now, police are saying there is an incontrovertible link between drugs coming into our city and our nation and the terror threat we all face. It's the thing liberals love most - the fact that their licentious behavior is putting the lives of all of us at deadly risk.
0x9BC14828=我们都知道自由主义者热爱毒品。从Vinewood的可卡因派对到充斥着摇头丸的郊区狂欢，从学龄前儿童喝的迷幻药到大学生注射的海洛因，没有什么比一个被毒品毁掉的家庭更能说明「自由主义亟需退出」了。目前，警方声称进入我们城市及我们国家的毒品和我们面临的恐怖威胁之间有着不容置疑的联系。这是自由主义者最喜欢的－他们放肆的行为正把我们所有人处于致命危险中。

;0x9CE90944=In a bow to terrorists, Mayor Ochoa shows classic liberal weakness by reopening the bridges between the outer boroughs and Algonquin. Does he not know we are at war and all need to make some sacrifices if our way of life and freedoms are to be protected? Apparently not. Now he's made life easy for both commuters and those who would do us harm. It's classic liberal wooly thinking. What's needed is a good simple conservative principle: punish everyone - then you know you'll get the bad guys. The Hickey Bridge and the Booth Tunnel remain closed.
0x9CE90944=市长Ochoa重新开放连接外城区和Algonquin的大桥这一行为展示出了自由主义的典型弱点，对恐怖分子服了软。难道他不知道如果我们的自由与生活方式不受保护，所有人都要处于战争状态中，所有人都要做出一些牺牲吗？显然他不知道。现在，他不仅让通勤族更方便了，更让那些想伤害我们的人更方便了。这是典型自由主义者的胡思乱想。我们需要的是一个良好的的朴素保守主义：惩罚每个人-抓住坏蛋。Hickey大桥和Booth隧道仍然尚处于关闭状态。

;0xAE00ECA7=Why? Because terrorists sell drugs to liberals to buy bombs to kill us all. It's really that simple. The police department said so yesterday and I for one believe them. Now that we finally have the truth, it isn't the military industrial complex that's the problem, so isn't it time that we punish drug addicts properly like the criminals they really are?
0xAE00ECA7=你问我为什么？因为恐怖分子向自由主义者贩卖毒品，来买炸弹杀死我们全部。就是这么简单。警察局昨天就这么说了，我相信他们。问题根本就不在军史工业复合体，既然我们终于知道了真相，现在该是我们像惩罚真正的罪犯那样惩罚吸毒者的时候了吗？
