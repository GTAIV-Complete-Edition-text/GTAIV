;0x9BC14828=We all know that liberals love drugs. From Vinewood cocaine parties to ecstasy-fueled swinging suburban romps, to pre-schoolers having their drinks laced with acid and college kids shooting up heroin, nothing says 'liberal drop out' like a family ruined by the ravages of drugs. Now, police are saying there is an incontrovertible link between drugs coming into our city and our nation and the terror threat we all face. It's the thing liberals love most - the fact that their licentious behavior is putting the lives of all of us at deadly risk.
0x9BC14828=我们都知道自由主义者热爱毒品。从好麦坞的可卡因派对到充斥着摇头丸的郊区狂欢，学龄前儿童喝迷幻药和大学生吸食海洛因，没有什么比一个被毒品毁掉的家庭更能说明「自由主义的退出」了。目前，警方称进入我们城市及我们国家的毒品和我们面临的恐怖威胁之间有着不容置疑的联系。这是自由主义者最喜欢的－他们放肆的行为正把我们所有人处于致命危险中。

;0x9CE90944=In a bow to terrorists, Mayor Ochoa shows classic liberal weakness by reopening the bridges between the outer boroughs and Algonquin. Does he not know we are at war and all need to make some sacrifices if our way of life and freedoms are to be protected? Apparently not. Now he's made life easy for both commuters and those who would do us harm. It's classic liberal wooly thinking. What's needed is a good simple conservative principle: punish everyone - then you know you'll get the bad guys. The Hickey Bridge and the Booth Tunnel remain closed.
0x9CE90944=为了向恐怖分子低头，Ochoa市长通过重新开放连接外城区和Algonquin的桥梁展示出了典型的自由主义弱点。难道他不知道我们所有人都处于斗争中而且如果我们的生活方式和自由要受到保护的话所有人都要做出一些牺牲吗？显然不知道。现在，他让那些经常通勤的人和想伤害我们的人活得更容易了。这是典型自由主义的胡思乱想。我们需要的是一个不错的简单保守主义：惩罚每个人－然后你就会发现那些坏蛋。Hickey大桥和Booth隧道仍然处于关闭状态。

;0xAE00ECA7=Why? Because terrorists sell drugs to liberals to buy bombs to kill us all. It's really that simple. The police department said so yesterday and I for one believe them. Now that we finally have the truth, it isn't the military industrial complex that's the problem, so isn't it time that we punish drug addicts properly like the criminals they really are?
0xAE00ECA7=为什么？因为恐怖分子们卖毒品给自由主义者来买炸弹杀死我们全部。就是这么简单。警察局昨天就这么说了，我相信他们。现在我们终于知道了真相，问题不在于军工联合体，所以现在不就是我们像惩罚真正的罪犯那样惩罚吸毒者的时候了吗？
