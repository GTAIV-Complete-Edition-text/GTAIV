;0x2F8DDDE3=Police have confirmed reports that a body they recovered was identified as Aiden O'Mally - the convict and possible one-time terrorist who was sprung from a prison van recently in a violent attack. At the time, it was presumed that O'Malley had friends in criminally high places. Now it seems he was freed so he could be silenced, or punished for past crimes. Police have no leads on what might have been behind the need to silence or kill Mr. O'Malley, 48. O'Malley was born and raised in Dukes but spent much of his adult life in Ireland and Britain, where he was thought to have links with several paramilitary and terrorist groups. Some experts claim that, since the ending of the Troubles, several former activists have returned to Liberty City and are engaged in the settling of old scores, while also getting involved in new forms of crime including drug dealing.
0x2F8DDDE3=警方证实，他们找到的一具尸体被确认为Aiden O'Mally，这名罪犯可能曾经是恐怖分子，他最近在一次暴力袭击中从一辆囚车里逃出来。当时，人们推测O'Mally在犯罪的高层有人脉。现在看来他被释放是为了封口，以避免因为过去的罪行受到惩罚。警方没有任何线索表明，让48岁的O'Malley闭口或杀死他的背后的目的是什么。O'Malley在Duke出生和长大，但成年后大部分时间都生活在爱尔兰和英国，在那里他被认为与几个准军事组织和恐怖组织有联系。一些专家声称，自骚乱结束以来，一些前活动人士返回自由城，参与了旧账的清算，同时也参与了包括毒品交易在内的新形式的犯罪活动。

;0x6FB2E799=He's not just a dork - he's also in serious medical trouble. That's right. The family member you worry about who is lost in the cyber hell of video games is not just a sociopath planning to kill you and everyone else you love, he is also threatening the future of the entire human race - by making himself impotent. Yes - video games - already responsible for most murders and 40% of all deaths in America, are also causing men to become impotent. Scientists paid for by a famous TV company said so yesterday and it seems probable. We will stay with this story, until the lack of evidence makes it impossible to do so while still retaining the tiny shred of journalistic dignity we have left.
0x6FB2E799=他不只是一个呆子，他还有严重的健康问题。没错。你担心沉溺于电子游戏的家庭成员不仅是一个计划杀死你和你爱的人的反社会者，他还威胁着整个人类的未来——通过使自己变得无能。是的——电子游戏——已经造成美国大部分谋杀案和40%的死亡，同时也导致了男性的性无能。由一家著名电视公司资助的科学家昨天这样说，这似乎是可能的。我们将继续报道这个故事，直到缺乏证据使我们不再能继续报道，同时仍然保留我们仅存的一点新闻尊严。
