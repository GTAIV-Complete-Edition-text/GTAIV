Have you stopped that world for good, or will you go back? Will you ever come back to me? It gladdens heart of mine to think of you and your cousin together, living a good life in America, and at the same time,
0x2BA2D11E=Nadam se da si dobro i da si srecan u Americi(愿你在美国一切顺利)。希望你能收到这封邮件，再给我回个信。我很想你。Roman告诉我他现在只会英语了，你应该也差不多吧，所以这封信是用英语写的。我知道你离开家乡会过得更好，但我依然想你。思念游子是母亲的责任。你不在船上干了吗？你是想就此留在外面的世界，还是回到故乡？你还会回到我身边吗？一想到你跟你堂兄一起，在美国过着好日子，我就很高兴；

;0x4BDA9191=the country flounders, British people come to buy holiday homes they never visit, the politicians argue and we all want things will change. I have long memory.

0x4BDA9191=国家原地踏步，英国人来这里买一辈子都不会住的度假屋，政治家各执己见。我们都希望情况能有所改变。我还记得以前的事，人生就是迷离又充满变数的，只是遇到的问题不同。我们不知道什么自由，也不知道民主。有时我觉得这样反倒让我们生活得更加轻松。
