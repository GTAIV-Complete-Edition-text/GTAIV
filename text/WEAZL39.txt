;0x28BF5650=The Liberty City metropolitan area continues to be the main target for pathetic terrorists in their war on freedom. They struck the American-owned AutoEroticar Showroom in West Alderney City, massacring everyone in sight. This comes soon after the recent slaughter of US citizens in the Acter Industrial Park by terrorists. Some reporters have decided to dig into the past of the victims of these massacres to suggest that they were somehow related to organized crime.
0x28BF5650=在那些可悲的恐怖分子们的「自由之战」中，Liberty City的大都会地区仍然是他们主要的袭击目标。这次他们又袭击了一家美国企业——位于West Alderney City的AutoEroticar Showroom，且将他们所见之人赶尽杀绝。继最近恐怖分子在Acter Industrial Park中针对美国民众的大屠杀后，恐怖惨剧如今又紧接着再度上演。然而某些记者却还想着深入挖掘在这些大屠杀中受害者们的过去，以证实这些惨案是与集团犯罪有某种联系的。

;0x60644599=It's disgusting. These people are American heroes. They have involuntarily given their lives for all of our freedom; what right do we have to dig into their past and make accusations and muddy the reputations of the dead? If N.O.O.S.E tells us these were acts of terrorism, then that's what they were. It's un-American of us to question that. N.O.O.S.E has said that a number of suspects have been extracted to offshore questioning centers. All I can say is thank god for that constitutional loophole.
0x60644599=这简直恶心至极。这些人可都是美国的英雄。他们都在无意中将生命奉献给我们的自由事业；我们又有何权利去乱挖他们的过去、妄图控告他们甚至还想玷污这些罹难者的英名呢？如果N.O.O.S.E跟我们说这些都是恐怖主义导演的惨剧，那的确正如他们所说。而谁要是质疑这一点，谁就是反美国的。N.O.O.S.E已发表通告，表示嫌犯已被转移到海上的调询中心。现在我只能说有那些宪法漏洞的存在真是谢天谢地。
