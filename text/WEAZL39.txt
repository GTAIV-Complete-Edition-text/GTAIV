;0x28BF5650=The Liberty City metropolitan area continues to be the main target for pathetic terrorists in their war on freedom. They struck the American-owned AutoEroticar Showroom in West Alderney City, massacring everyone in sight. This comes soon after the recent slaughter of US citizens in the Acter Industrial Park by terrorists. Some reporters have decided to dig into the past of the victims of these massacres to suggest that they were somehow related to organized crime.
0x28BF5650=在那些可悲的恐怖分子们的「自由之战」中，自由城大都会地区仍是他们的主要袭击目标。这次他们又袭击了一家美国企业——位于西Alderney市的AutoEroticar展厅，将所见之人全数杀害。继最近在Acter工业园的美国公民屠杀后，恐怖惨剧再度上演。然而某些记者却还在挖掘受害者们的过去，试图证实这些惨案与有组织犯罪有关。

;0x60644599=It's disgusting. These people are American heroes. They have involuntarily given their lives for all of our freedom; what right do we have to dig into their past and make accusations and muddy the reputations of the dead? If N.O.O.S.E tells us these were acts of terrorism, then that's what they were. It's un-American of us to question that. N.O.O.S.E has said that a number of suspects have been extracted to offshore questioning centers. All I can say is thank god for that constitutional loophole.
0x60644599=实在太恶心了。这些人可都是美国的英雄。他们都在无意中将生命献给了我们的自由事业，我们又有何权利去乱挖他们的过去、妄图控告他们，甚至去玷污遇难者的英名呢？如果国安办说这些屠杀都是恐怖袭击，那它就是恐怖袭击。谁敢质疑，谁就是反美国。国安办说嫌疑人已被运送到海外的讯问中心，我只能说得亏宪法存在这些漏洞。
