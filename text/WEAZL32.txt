;0x312C1C21=Liberty City's Deputy Police Commissioner, Francis McReary, was ruthlessly gunned down earlier. To most of us he is a hero, a man dedicated to serving the city who was taken before his time. Liberal "Blame America First" news outlets have been sullying the man's reputation. Rather than celebrate this patriot's great career, they dig up some unsubstantiated accusations of corruption. Francis McReary valiantly served Liberty City until he was murdered. We should remember him as an American Hero.
0x312C1C21=自由城的警局副局长Francis McReary于早些时候惨遭枪杀。对于我们大多数人来说，他是英雄，是一个为自由城勤恳奉献的人，但他却英年早逝。那些「凡事都怪美国」的自由派媒体一直在抹黑他，他们不去称赞这位爱国英雄的丰功伟绩，却在宣传无凭无据的贪污指控。Francis McReary为自由城鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已，我们应当把他当作美国英雄纪念。
