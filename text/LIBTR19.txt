;0x8B263EA6=There was another brutal murder in Hove Beach today. This time, however, police do not believe it is related to the ever-tightening hold of the Russian mafia on the area. The victim, a Mr. Tom Rivas, had told the owner of the 69th Street Diner that he was on a "hot date." He was then seen in a romantic context with an older, "foreign-looking" man. Moments later, he was dead. Mr. Rivas was unemployed but is reported to have had a number of older boyfriends who supported him. Police are currently pursuing all leads in the hope that one will lead them to the killer.
0x8B263EA6=今天在Hove Beach又发生了一起残忍的谋杀。然而，警方认为这起谋杀与在当地势力渐增的俄罗斯黑帮无关。受害者是Tom Rivas先生，遇害前他告诉69街餐馆的老板，自己是来「激情约会」的。有人目击受害者与一位年迈的、「长得像外国人」的男子卿卿我我。片刻之后，他死了。Rivas当时没有工作，但有消息称其有许多年长的男友作为经济来源。警方目前正在追查所有线索，希望能找到凶手。

;0xBC2DB436=Another shipment of cloned medication was intercepted at the docks today. The haul included counterfeit drugs used to treat depression and erectile dysfunction. A spokesman for Betta Pharmaceuticals, producer of the erectile dysfunction treatment drug, Mollis, has warned of the harmful effects of cloned medication. "Not only do these actions undermine the economy, but they can be very dangerous. We spend years putting our drugs through clinical trials and giving lab monkeys exploding erections. These guys brew something up in their basement and illegally ship it into the marketplace." Last year, a man in Las Venturas took some cloned Mollis and accidentally killed his wife when the toxic brew caused him to experience 18 days of priapism.
0xBC2DB436=今日，码头又截获了一批仿制药，包括治疗抑郁症和勃起功能障碍的药物。生产治疗勃起功能障碍药物Mollis的贝塔制药的一位发言人对仿制药物的有害影响作出预警：「走私仿制药不仅破坏经济，还非常危险。我们花了数年时间才让我们的药通过临床试验，让实验室里的猴子雄风大振。这些人就在地下室酿了些东西，然后非法流入市场。」去年，拉斯文加斯一男子服用仿制的Mollis，这一毒药让他持续勃起18天，害死了其妻子。
