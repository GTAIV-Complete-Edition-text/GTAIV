;0x8B263EA6=There was another brutal murder in Hove Beach today. This time, however, police do not believe it is related to the ever-tightening hold of the Russian mafia on the area. The victim, a Mr. Tom Rivas, had told the owner of the 69th Street Diner that he was on a "hot date." He was then seen in a romantic context with an older, "foreign-looking" man. Moments later, he was dead. Mr. Rivas was unemployed but is reported to have had a number of older boyfriends who supported him. Police are currently pursuing all leads in the hope that one will lead them to the killer.
0x8B263EA6=今天在Hove Beach又发生了一起残忍的谋杀案。然而，这一次，警方认为这与俄罗斯黑手党对该地区日益加强的控制无关。受害者是Tom Rivas先生，他告诉69街餐馆的老板，他正在「热恋」。随后，他与一位年长的、「看起来像外国人」的男子出现在浪漫的场景中。不一会儿，他死了。Rivas当时没有工作，但据报道，他有很多年长的男朋友支持他。警方目前正在追查所有线索，希望能找到凶手。

;0xBC2DB436=Another shipment of cloned medication was intercepted at the docks today. The haul included counterfeit drugs used to treat depression and erectile dysfunction. A spokesman for Betta Pharmaceuticals, producer of the erectile dysfunction treatment drug, Mollis, has warned of the harmful effects of cloned medication. "Not only do these actions undermine the economy, but they can be very dangerous. We spend years putting our drugs through clinical trials and giving lab monkeys exploding erections. These guys brew something up in their basement and illegally ship it into the marketplace." Last year, a man in Las Venturas took some cloned Mollis and accidentally killed his wife when the toxic brew caused him to experience 18 days of priapism.
0xBC2DB436=今天在码头又截获了一批仿制药物。查获的假药包括治疗抑郁症和勃起功能障碍的假药。勃起功能障碍治疗药物生产商Betta Pharmaceuticals的一位发言人对仿制药物的有害影响发出了警告。他说:「这些行动不仅破坏经济，而且可能非常危险。我们花了数年时间让我们的药物通过临床试验，并让实验室里的猴子勃起。这些人在他们的地下室里酿造一些东西，然后非法运到市场上。」去年，Las Venturas的一名男子服用了一些仿制的Mollis，有毒物质导致他经历了18天的阴茎异常勃起，并且不小心杀死了他的妻子。
