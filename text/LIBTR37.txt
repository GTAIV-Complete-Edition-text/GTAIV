N.O.O.S.E operatives have started to find high-quality counterfeit $100 bills in circulation in Liberty City. They are believed to be so-called supernotes - fake currency using identical ink and paper to genuine bills printed overseas. Police believe the current batch originates from Asia. N.O.O.S.E estimates that among $100 bills one in every fifty is counterfeit.

;0xE9CFF469=No more bending over backwards or having a rib removed to give yourself oral treats. Scientists have performed a successful experiment that will allow you to clone yourself. But the question on everyone's lips - is it ok for your clone to give you a hand job, or for you to engage in sodomy with your clone? Dr. Yahann Klietzel, a prominent reproductive scientist and geneticist says, "This is a breakthrough in science. Finally we are able to clone ourselves, so while your clone is going to work and making the money, you are able to stay at home and masturbate and play video games, just like women. And when your clone comes home, you can enjoy each other in any way you want. Truly, this is the future." Klietzel added, "Oh, yes, it is not gay."
0xE9CFF469=你再也不需要弯腰或者后仰着给自己做口腔治疗了，科学家们已经成功地做了一个可以让你克隆自己的实验。但每个人都可能提出的问题是——你确定让克隆人给你打飞机没问题吗？或者直接来场鸡奸？著名的生殖科学家和遗传科学家Yahann Klietzel说：「这是科学上的一次突破，最终我们可以克隆自己，所以当你的克隆人外出工作挣钱的时候，你可以像个家庭主妇一样在家里打飞机和玩游戏。并且当你的克隆人回家以后，你们可以用任何你们想要的方式来享受彼此。确实，这就是未来。」Klietzel还补充道：「还好，我不是同性恋。」
