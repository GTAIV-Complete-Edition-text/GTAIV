Again it involved members of the Pavano crime family and again the National Office of Security Enforcement is calling it an act of terror. Whether this is an act against AutoEroticar, the retailer where the shooting took place, or the mobsters who were slaughtered, N.O.O.S.E would not say. However, they have stated that several suspects have been airlifted from Liberty City to an offshore questioning centre. These massacres have changed the spirit of Alderney forever. No more will that patch of land on the other side of the West River be associated with good working-class values, polluted swamps, spray-on tans, big hair, violent racist masculinity and other American-as-apple-pie attitudes of the suburbs. Maybe it's time to think about blocking the Booth Tunnel once and for all.",

Suspicions as to the pilot's state of mind had been raised even before take-off when he welcomed passengers \"aboard the party bus\" and announced that, \"in the unlikely event of landing on water, the woman in 15B has two beautiful flotation devices.\" Over the course of the 2-hour flight, he became audibly more boisterous and incoherent singing, \"Who wants to sit on the captain's knee?\" and shouting things like \"Kamikaze\" and \"Look no hands\" as the plane came into land. \"He even asked an air hostess for a sickbag at one point,\" said one terrified passenger. The 48-year-old father of two was questioned by Francis International authorities before driving home.",

Now it's all happening again. This time it is thought to also include mobsters from Alderney, who have broken away from the five families and are seeking political parity with them. Who knew mobsters were such social climbers? Well, crime expert Jimmy Cast for starters. He told us, \"Mobsters are all vain - this war is not only a war for financial power, it is also a war for social control over the city. Expect more bodies to turn up before things calm down. The Alderney mob are known to be lawless and I imagine the older families will also be nervous as the DA's office uses this as an opportunity to indict several mobsters across the city in another massive crackdown on organized crime.\" Mayor Ochoa said, \"We are close to eradicating this menace once and for all. From now on, only big businesses and the government should rob our people.\"",
