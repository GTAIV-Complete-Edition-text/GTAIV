;0x0BE24697=Alright, so Bobby Jefferson went out of his way to praise some immigrants while he was damning others in his speech at the Civic Citadel. He argued that 99% of the people who come into this country are honest (I'd like to see the statistics to back that one up, by the way) and believe in the same things that patriotic American citizens do. He then went on to say that, besides terrorism, the biggest threat to American safety at the moment is these gangsters coming into Liberty City from Russia and Eastern Europe and setting up shop in immigrant communities like Hove Beach.
0x0BE24697=好吧，所以说Boddy Jefferson在Civic Citadel发表的演说中可谓是煞费苦心地赞美移民，同时也毫不留情地诅咒其他人。他认为，这个国家99%的外来者都是诚实(顺便一提，我倒想瞧瞧这观点背后的数据)且与我们美国的爱国者们信仰着同一个信条。他还继续强调，除了恐怖主义，目前对美国国民安全的最大威胁，就是来自俄国和东欧的黑帮歹徒们虫蛀在Liberty City中，并且还在诸如Hove Beach这样的移民社区里开张店铺。

0x1241359D=别再叨扰Eris了

;0x1E496B65=Firstly, if people are going to come over to our country they should adopt to our customs of growing obese and loving bad sitcoms. Also, learn our language, even if we haven't quite properly mastered it yet. They shouldn't go somewhere like Hove Beach which is more Russian than some parts of Moscow. If these guys are such a threat, then why don't we just close the borders to everyone? I say close the borders to these bastards. Remember, 9 in 10 terrorists are foreign too.
0x1E496B65=首先，如果有人想移民我们国家，他们应该学会适应我们肥佬式的习惯以及对垃圾情景剧的狂热。同时，还要学习我们的语言，尽管这是我们自己也没完全掌握的。他们不该去类似于Hove Beach这样俄国佬比莫斯科的某些地区都还多的地方。要是这些家伙是一种威胁，那我们为什么不对所有人都封锁边境呢？我是说，对所有的那些混蛋封锁边境。也要时刻记住，10个恐怖分子里面，9个都是外国佬。

;0x1FA80597=For years, sneaker manufacturer Eris has been made the villain by work-shy lefties for choosing to help third world countries. Historically, Eris's visionary founder, Pete Vassal, has kept quiet, refusing to descend to the level of veggie hypocrites who are more than happy to take a welfare check from the same government that they profess to despise. However, after years of silence, Vassal has now chosen to speak out against the rants of stoned human rights activists the world over.
0x1FA80597=由于数年来被好吃懒做的左翼分子们选中去援助第三世界国家，运动鞋制造商Eris现已转良为娼。曾几何时，Eric的那位富有远见的缔造者，Pete Vassal，始终保持沉默，拒绝拉低自己身位去跟他们所宣告鄙视的、巴不得从我们的政府抽出大笔社保资金的伪君子们沆瀣一气。然而在经过数年的沉默后，Vassal现已被选中在世界平台上为反对吸毒者人权运动发声。

;0x4A4F5AE5=In an online missive that delivers a powerful blow to the heart of the liberal manifesto, Vassal poses the hard-hitting questions that most in our politically-correct society no longer dare to ask, such as, "What would you rather do? Starve or earn 10 cents an hour?"
0x4A4F5AE5=在对自由派宣言进行致命打击的一次网络集会中，Vassal谈及了几个当下的热点问题，他表示现在我们大多数政治上正确的社会问题都不再敢直接提出了，例如，「饥寒交迫或者每小时挣10美分，你更愿意做哪个？」

;0x56B8A3F9=Thankfully, we are not complete losers. We've almost won one war - fun has almost been defeated. Nightclub-owning degenerate, Tony Prince, noted yesterday that Liberty City has been transformed into a strip mall. And not before time. The quicker we shut all of the night clubs there the better. Fun can be stopped, and we will prove it.
0x56B8A3F9=谢天谢地，我们还不是彻底的失败者。我们几乎都要打赢了这场战争——至死娱乐几乎就要被击垮了。堕落的夜总会老板，Tony Prince，于昨日强调道，Liberty City已转型成为一座巨型购物中心。而事实上也早该如此了。我们越尽快关掉所有的夜店，对我们就越有益。至死娱乐能够被制止，而我们将会证明它。

;0x5C01FE4A=The unfortunate truth is that tree-huggers would rather see third-world communities unemployed and homeless than working for a successful corporation. An Indonesian child is not going to thank a dreadlocked middle-class hippy for closing down her only source of income and sending her back to a life of crime, prostitution and cannibalism.
0x5C01FE4A=一个不幸的事实就是，那些环境保护狂更宁愿让第三世界社会所有人失业并流离失所，而不愿跟他们精诚合作。一个印尼孩子可不会因为一个蓄「骇人」长发绺的中产嬉皮士断绝了她唯一的收入来源，并把她送回满是犯罪，卖淫和啃食人肉的生活而感激他。

0xB4735F6D=某些决策者称，「我们应该专注于这场战争，所以我们不能再像当年对付纳粹那样左右开弓，犯同样的错误。让我们先干掉至死的娱乐，然后再去关注我们所憎恨的别的东西，就像欧洲那样。」
