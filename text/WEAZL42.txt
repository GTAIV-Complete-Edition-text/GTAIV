;0x0BE24697=Alright, so Bobby Jefferson went out of his way to praise some immigrants while he was damning others in his speech at the Civic Citadel. He argued that 99% of the people who come into this country are honest (I'd like to see the statistics to back that one up, by the way) and believe in the same things that patriotic American citizens do. He then went on to say that, besides terrorism, the biggest threat to American safety at the moment is these gangsters coming into Liberty City from Russia and Eastern Europe and setting up shop in immigrant communities like Hove Beach.
0x0BE24697=好吧，所以说Boddy Jefferson在Civic Citadel发表的演说中可谓是煞费苦心地赞美移民，同时也毫不留情地咒骂其他人。他认为，这个国家99%的外来者都是诚实的(顺便一提，我倒想瞧瞧支持这一观点的数据)，且与我们美国的爱国者信仰相同。他还强调，除了恐怖主义，目前对美国国民安全的最大威胁，就是自由城中来自俄国和东欧的黑帮歹徒，他们还在Hove Beach这样的移民社区里开张店铺。

;0x1E496B65=Firstly, if people are going to come over to our country they should adopt to our customs of growing obese and loving bad sitcoms. Also, learn our language, even if we haven't quite properly mastered it yet. They shouldn't go somewhere like Hove Beach which is more Russian than some parts of Moscow. If these guys are such a threat, then why don't we just close the borders to everyone? I say close the borders to these bastards. Remember, 9 in 10 terrorists are foreign too.
0x1E496B65=首先，如果有人想移民我们国家，他们应该学会适应我们的肥佬习惯、爱上垃圾情景剧。同时，还要学习我们的语言，尽管我们自己也没有完全掌握。他们不该去类似于Hove Beach这种俄国佬比莫斯科的某些地区都多的地方。要是这些家伙是一种威胁，那我们为什么不对所有人都封锁边境呢？我是说，对所有的那些混蛋封锁边境。时刻记住，10个恐怖分子里面，9个都是外国佬。

;0x1FA80597=For years, sneaker manufacturer Eris has been made the villain by work-shy lefties for choosing to help third world countries. Historically, Eris's visionary founder, Pete Vassal, has kept quiet, refusing to descend to the level of veggie hypocrites who are more than happy to take a welfare check from the same government that they profess to despise. However, after years of silence, Vassal has now chosen to speak out against the rants of stoned human rights activists the world over.
0x1FA80597=多年来，运动鞋制造商Eris一直被好吃懒做的左派塑造成坏人，只因为Eris在帮助第三世界国家、此前，富有远见的Eris创始人Pete Vassal始终保持沉默，拒绝把自己降低到和那些素食伪君子同样的水平，后者一边反对政府，一边巴不得政府给他发福利支票。然而在经过数年的沉默后，Vassal终于发声反对了那些吸毒的人权活动家。

;0x4A4F5AE5=In an online missive that delivers a powerful blow to the heart of the liberal manifesto, Vassal poses the hard-hitting questions that most in our politically-correct society no longer dare to ask, such as, "What would you rather do? Starve or earn 10 cents an hour?"
0x4A4F5AE5=Vassal用一篇长文对自由派的主张进行了有力反击，他提出了我国被政治正确束缚的人们不敢提出的问题，比如「」
Vassal谈及了几个当下的热点问题，他表示现在我们大多数政治上正确的社会问题都不再敢直接提出了，例如，「如果让你选，你会选择饿死还是10美分的时薪？」

;0x56B8A3F9=Thankfully, we are not complete losers. We've almost won one war - fun has almost been defeated. Nightclub-owning degenerate, Tony Prince, noted yesterday that Liberty City has been transformed into a strip mall. And not before time. The quicker we shut all of the night clubs there the better. Fun can be stopped, and we will prove it.
0x56B8A3F9=谢天谢地，我们还不是彻底的失败者。我们就快要打赢一场战争了——娱乐就要被击垮了。堕落的夜店老板，Tony Prince，于昨日表示，自由城已经变成小商场了。而且比原定计划更早。我们越尽快关掉所有夜店，对我们就越有益。至死娱乐能够被制止，而我们会证明它。

;0x5C01FE4A=The unfortunate truth is that tree-huggers would rather see third-world communities unemployed and homeless than working for a successful corporation. An Indonesian child is not going to thank a dreadlocked middle-class hippy for closing down her only source of income and sending her back to a life of crime, prostitution and cannibalism.
0x5C01FE4A=不幸的是，那些环境保护狂宁愿让第三世界的居民失业、流离失所，也不愿意让他们替一家成功企业工作。留着脏辫的中产嬉皮士断绝了一个印尼女孩唯一的收入来源，让她回到了满是犯罪、卖淫和吃人的生活，受害者可不会感谢他。

0xB4735F6D=某些决策者称：「我们应该专注于这场战争，所以我们不能犯下与纳粹同样的错误两线作战。我们要先干掉娱乐，再集火我们所憎恨的别的东西，比如欧洲。」
