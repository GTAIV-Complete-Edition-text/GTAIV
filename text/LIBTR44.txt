;0xD047AF34=The music was powerful, the conversations were earnest and the sex was mind-blowing. It seemed like the party was never going to end. Then it did. You got a bit fat around the middle. You began having serious conversations about mortgages. Ravers and party goers emerged from the best decade of their lives only to be hit with the grim reality that they were going to pay the price for all that fun. Ten years later, people are starting to worry when all the devastating long-term effects are going to kick in. The answer is any minute. "Every time I get a cold or forget my keys, I am convinced that it's the beginning of the end; that I'm going to be found rocking in darkened room in a state of permanent catatonia from all that LSD, Ecstasy and weed I did," said James, a 33-year-old lawyer from Algonquin, "If it doesn't happen soon, I'm going to dust off the white gloves and glow sticks and get back out there."

;0xFC819B60=The tragic death of Charles Pathmanson became even more tragic as investigators say a tragic tale of tragedy is unfolding in the tragic emails sent to Pathmanson days before his tragic tragedy. Known to have built the "Kitchen of the Future", Pathmanson had been battling hackers who had broken into his appliances and began turning them on and off, setting his oven at 500 degrees in the middle of the night, fatally breaking the ice machine, and continually making the toaster pop up and down. In an act of desperation, Pathmanson attempted to install a firewall and new motherboard in the toaster, at which point hackers switched it on and electrocuted him. Police are trolling online games and "asking these snotfaced little egomaniacal griefers if they know anything about it," Police investigator Mike Loretti said in a statement.
0xFC819B60=Charles Pathmanson的悲惨死亡变得更加悲惨，因为调查人员说，在他的悲剧发生前几天，他收到了一封悲惨的电子邮件，其中讲述了一个悲剧的故事。Pathmanson制造了「未来的厨房」，一直在与黑客作战，他们黑入了他的电器，并开始打开和关闭，在半夜把他的烤箱设置在500度，不可避免地破坏了制冰机，并不停地让烤面包机反复弹出。在一次铤而走险的行为中，Pathmanson试图在烤面包机上安装防火墙和新主板，这时，黑客们把它打开电死了他。警方调查人员Mike Loretti在一份声明中说：「警方正在调查网络赌博，并询问这些势利的自大狂是否知道这件事。」
