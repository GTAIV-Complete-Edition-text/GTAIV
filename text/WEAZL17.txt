;0x469C0D0A=The BAWSAQ 100 limped home after losing 23 - that's right, TWENTY THREE points, in what many in the financial sector are equating to Armageddon. That's right, Armageddon. And the four horses of the beast will come down and lay ravage to the land if the Fed doesn't spring into action immediately. Investors shrugged off the 896 trillion dollars owed in debt by the US and got a fresh injection of 85 billion into securities markets aimed at lubricating mortgage losses. Honestly, this financial market shit is wicked fucking boring and I wish I could write for the style section or about hip hop, homey.
0x469C0D0A=BAWSAQ 100指数下跌23点疲软收盘。没错，二十三点，对大多数金融从业者来说等同于末日。没错，末日。如果联邦政府再不采取措施，天启四骑士将会下凡蹂躏这片土地。投资者们不在乎国家欠他们的896万亿，又向证券市场注资850亿，以弥补抵押贷款损失。说实话，金融市场这块真的是无聊到爆了，希望我以后能去替时尚版供稿，或者写些关于嘻哈的文章，哥们儿。
