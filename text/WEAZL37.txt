;0x89DFCFAC=It's feels like the 80's all over again, but instead of communists besting our sports heroes and boycotting our Olympics, now they've invaded your wallet. The American dollar is being systematically devalued by counterfeit $100 bills thought to have originated in communist countries. Previously, US authorities had only found these bills in Europe and Asia. Suddenly, they are appearing in huge quantities on home soil. These counterfeits are too sophisticated to be manufactured on a homemade press in this country.
0x89DFCFAC=这感觉就像再次回到了80年代，但不同的是不再有共产党打击我们的运动英雄并且全面抵制我们的奥林匹克运动会了，如今，他们已经入侵了你的钱包。由于被伪造的$100面值的纸币被认为起源于共产主义国家，美元现已被依法贬值。此前，美国官方机构仅在欧洲和亚洲查获这些假钞。最近这些假钞竟爆炸性地出现在美国本土。然而国内的家用复印机根本不可能做出工艺如此复杂的假钞。
