;0x052A2874=Despite our repeated warnings, terrorists have attacked Liberty City again. This time the target was a fueling depot in Northwood. Some liberal news outlets are trying to spin this into a story about the Mafia. They're saying that the explosion was related to organized crime rather than terror. These leftist loons are crazy. They'll say and do anything before they admit that terrorism is the number one problem facing the nation and much more important than any of their pet projects, the environment, health care and ludicrous foreign welfare projects.
0x052A2874=且先不管那些重复不停的警报，恐怖分子如今已再次袭击Liberty City。这次他们的目标是一家位于Northwood的加油站。某些自由派新闻媒体妄图把本次事件编造成黑手党所为。他们称本次爆炸事件应该是一次有组织、有预谋的犯罪而非恐怖袭击。这些左派野蛮人简直就是疯子。他们无论如何都不会承认恐怖主义是这个国家的燃眉之急，而且它绝对比他们的宠物项目、环保宣言、健康保障还有扯淡的外国福利企划要重要得多。

;0x2CA36474=Proof that the government is doing all that it can to protect home owners and families came through from Liberty City with the news that, in a city in which not much goes right, the cost of living remains reassuringly high. Although the city is plagued by social problems, and has a massive shortfall of strip malls and obesity compared with rest of this great nation, at least they are keeping the economy strong.
0x2CA36474=政府尽其所能保护业主和居民家庭的证据来自这样的消息：在这样一个诸事都不太顺利的城市里，居民生活成本仍然高得「令人放心」。尽管这座城被许多社会问题困扰着，对沿街商店管理也存在很多不足，而且较之于这个伟大国家的其他地方肥胖症病发更严重，但它至少仍保持着强大的经济实力。

0x2F670251=Ochoa对Weazel的警告不屑一顾

;0x78340E86=Even more alarming, the LCPD forensic team has found a triggering device at the scene which may have been activated by a cell phone. It is more than likely that this was just the first of many planned bombings. If you see a foreigner using a cell phone, he is probably a terrorist. Act first, ask questions later. You have the safety of your fellow Americans to consider as well as your own.
0x78340E86=尽管发出了更多的警报，LCPD法医团队还是在案发现场发现了一个触发装置，而它可能已经通过手机启动了。很有可能，这仅仅是众多炸弹阴谋的开端。要是你瞧见一个老外在用手机，那他就很可能是个恐怖分子。记住，先做，后问。不仅是你的美国同胞们，还有你自己的人身安全都是你该照料的。

;0x85FEAA1B=Witnesses saw a "foreign looking man" walking away from the warehouse. What more evidence does the President need before the borders are shut to America-hating immigrants?
0x85FEAA1B=有数位目击者称看见一名「外国样貌」的男子从一个仓库离开。那么，在向仇美移民封锁边境前，我们的总统还需要更多的证据吗？

;0xF2C270AF=While this is bad news for some, it's good news for us as we are big supporters of those who help themselves. Especially when those who help themselves are the already wealthy figuring out a way to stay rich. Above all, good house prices are good for us as we have literally nothing else to talk about over dinner. We grew up in the 1980s after all, so missed out on hippies and swinging and ideas.
0xF2C270AF=对我们这些坚定的自食其力拥护者们来说，这确是一个好消息，然而对某些人来说则不然。这种现象尤其发生在那些自食其力者们发财以后，并想通过一定手段保持财富时。综上，合理的房价对我们是有益的，不然我们在晚餐桌上就真的没啥可聊的了。毕竟我们都在80年代长大成人，所以也就错过了嬉皮士，错过了狂欢的摇摆，也错过了那些奇妙的想法。
