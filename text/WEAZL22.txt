;0xF05A5BC4=The Libertonian Museum has been closed for renovation for several months now, not that anyone would notice. This columnist, for one, wants it to stay that way. It is a liberal establishment aiming to infect anyone who visits it with godlessness. Anyone who sees the fossil exhibit will understand this - it completely fails to present the real side of the so-called dinosaur debate. At no point do they alert visitors to the possibility that these beasts were put there to test our faith.
0xF05A5BC4=Libertonian Museum至今已经闭馆休整数月，然而这并没有引起人们注意。作为本专栏作者，我倒是更希望它别再开放。该馆充满自由派风格，旨在感染那些所有前来参观的无神论者。但所有前来参观其化石展的人都会明白这一点——即它完全没有呈现出所谓恐龙争议的真实的一面。而他们却丝毫没有警告游客们这些猛兽被放在那里以考验我们信仰的可能性。
