0x6D05557C=美利坚合众国是一个伟大的国家，其根基就是家传教义和教育。在自由城博物馆重新开馆后，如果这些没被他们与所谓的科学论据一起展出，我会让我的孩子继续在家学习一年。

;0xF05A5BC4=The Libertonian Museum has been closed for renovation for several months now, not that anyone would notice. This columnist, for one, wants it to stay that way. It is a liberal establishment aiming to infect anyone who visits it with godlessness. Anyone who sees the fossil exhibit will understand this - it completely fails to present the real side of the so-called dinosaur debate. At no point do they alert visitors to the possibility that these beasts were put there to test our faith.
0xF05A5BC4=自由城博物馆已经闭馆翻修数月，尽管很多人都没有发现。但本文作者希望它能一直闭馆。自由城博物馆是一个自由派设施，用于向所有参观者灌输无神论思想。任何一个见过化石展的人都知道，这些化石展完全没能展现所谓恐龙争论*的真相(即神创论和进化论之争)。他们完全忽视了一种可能：这些怪物是上帝创造出来考验我们信仰的。他们没有告诉参观者这种可能的存在。
