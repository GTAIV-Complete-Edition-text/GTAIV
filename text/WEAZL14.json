            "original": "In a statement issued today, Mayor Julio Ochoa suggested that he is considering succumbing to public pressure to reopen the bridges separating the Eastern Boroughs from Algonquin, despite the ongoing threat of terrorism. Commuter groups and government agencies are at war over the matter. Officials contend that anything that could be a target should be shut down by martial law. Mayor Ochoa has suggested the possibility of these bridges reopening despite the inevitable bloody consequences. Is this a fair price to pay for increased convenience?",
            "translated": "在今天发表的声明中，Julio Ochoa市长表示尽管恐怖威胁依然存在，但他正考虑向民众的抗议压力低头，开放连接东部地区和Algonquin的几座大桥。通勤族和政府机构就此事争论已久。官员认为，任何可能成为袭击目标的地方都应当军管戒严。Ochoa市长提议开放桥梁，尽管这将带来无可避免的伤害性后果。为了换取交通便利，这种代价是否值得？",

It's a natural consequence of the liberal hegemony and the decline in civil society since the 60s 'me' generation ruined our society and gave our enemies hope. Hope that I would crush out of them with a bomb, just as I would bomb all of those awful online dating sites and make people learn proper social skills and proper manners. This is a war America, and it's a war I intend to win. It's a war on cowardice, and it will be the subject of my next book.",
