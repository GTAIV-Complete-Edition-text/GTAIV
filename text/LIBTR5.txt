;0x315B0327=Today, members of the media and activist groups had mixed reactions to Liberty City's Police Commissioner for Public Affairs Tom Pireni's presentation on police brutality. The "Wing It" slideshow presentation was given to the media today, arguing that the "Broker Bridge Incident" is not considered police brutality. After a bizarre musical performance, many residents were not convinced. Several residents have filed formal complaints after footage today showing several women and children being thrown off the bridge by police. Police argue that the footage does not tell the real story.
0x315B0327=今天，LCPD公共事务处处长Tom Pireni就警察暴力执法发表演讲，媒体人员和维权组织对此反应不一。他在利用「Wing It」幻灯片软件进行的演讲中表示，「Broker桥事件」未非警察暴力执法。在一段莫名其妙的音乐演出之后，许多市民对此仍难以信服。观看了今天几名妇女儿童被扔下桥的录像后，一些市民正式起诉警方。警方则称那段录像未能反映客观事实。

;0x348D5BE0=Police say after an anonymous tip from an elderly resident in the Steinway section of the city that law enforcement officers discovered three suspects in a portable methamphetamine lab. Liberty City Police, N.O.O.S.E agents and Bureau of Narcotics officials did not release the names of the suspects but indicated meth is a serious problem in Liberty City. "Meth has destroyed the lives and businesses of cocaine dealers in Vice City, and we see the same happening here," said agent Albert Thomas. Thomas would not indicate what made the elderly resident call in the tip but said that the woman smelled like an old person and reminded him of when his grandmother showed him her junk.
