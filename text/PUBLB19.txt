;0x12955EE5=Critics are divided and have promised a symposium on the subject. One anthropologist noted, "Web 2.0 is a revelation - there's no doubt about it - or the fact is my career has gone nowhere as a serious academic so I'm now doing a paper on the internet in a bid to get some TV appearances and tenure that way. My next book will have a controversial title, and probably feature tits." The debate continues, until someone stops the funding.
0x12955EE5=批判人士意见不一，并承诺将就此问题召开研讨会。一位人类学家指出，「毋庸置疑，Web 2.0是一个启示。说实话，作为一名正经学者，我的事业已经无路可走，所以我正在写一篇关于互联网的论文，希望能借此获得上电视的机会和终身职称。我的下一本书的标题或将引起争议，不过很可能会以奶子为特色。」争论还将继续，直到有人停止资助。

;0xB9D32D62=Sociologists and other irrelevant academics have begun to furiously debate the question on everyone's lips - web 2.0: is it interesting, or not? It seems no one can decide. Certainly people turning their lives into content for everyone else to watch online and then turn into their own content for others to listen to and blog about has taken art and broadcasting from the elite to the masses. Is it in fact one of the most boring things we've ever witnessed?
0xB9D32D62=社会学家和其他不相干的学者已经开始激烈地讨论备受关注的问题：Web 2.0能否带来新意？似乎没人能够给出定论。人们把自己的生活变成任何人都能在线观看的内容，然后再变成自己的谈资，用于撰写博客，这确实让艺术和传媒从精英阶层走向了大众。这真的是我们所见过的最无趣的事情吗?
