;0xC5559754=But leftist loons have opened the borders to evil people hell bent on the destruction of our freedom. Everyday we allow foreign nationals to enter this country. They steal American jobs, they seduce American women, soon enough they will bomb American subways. The only answer is to take these leftwing loons, obsessed with political correctness, out of office. I'm talking about people like Jacquise Benson, Doris Fung, and Mary Mayfly - liberals in City Hall who care more about the freedom of terrorists than the freedom of American citizens.
0xC5559754=但左派的蠢驴已让国门洞开，让那些恶鬼得以肆意践踏我们的自由。我们每天都放行外国人进入本国，他们窃取美国人的工作，糟蹋美国人的姑娘，早晚还要炸了美国人的地铁。解决这些问题的唯一方法，就是让那些天天搞政治正确的左驴下台。说的就是Jacquie Benson、Doris Fung和Mary Mayfly，比起美国公民的自由，这几个市政厅里的自由派居然更在乎恐怖分子的自由。

;0xF20C70C1=The terror threat level in Liberty City has stayed at Magenta 5 for the last year. Liberty City is the jewel in the crown of the United States of America. It is a country that is indisputably the only world power and should fear no one. Why is it that citizens of this great country are scared of the violent actions of a marginalized group? People in Algonquin, Broker, Bohan, Dukes and Alderney are justifiably scared of a horrific act of terrorism because this country has not put the correct measures in place to protect itself. Americans have a constitutional right to be protected from foreigners.
0xF20C70C1=去年以来，自由城的恐怖威胁等级一直是紫红色级(5级)。自由城是美利坚合众国皇冠上的明珠，而美国毫无疑问是无所畏惧的世界霸权。但为什么，生活在这般伟大国家的国民，还会被边缘小团体的暴行给吓倒呢？全都因为这个国家未能及时采取措施自保，居住在Algonquin、Broker、Bohan、Dukes和Alderney的人们才会理所当然地害怕恐怖主义行径。宪法可是赋予了美国人不被外国人侵犯的权利的。

;0xFC0944E5=Just imagine - it's 98 degrees outside and you have to walk to work. No air-conditioned comfortable SUV to sit in traffic in. No listening to your favorite WKTT radio shows in the morning commute. Or worse yet, sitting on a smelly train with no-manners immigrants shoving curry in their faces and clipping their toenails while they mutter "death to America." This is the future the liberals have planned if new global warming legislation is passed. While the rest of the first world may have bought science's lies, we haven't. Call your congressman and tell him (or if you are really unfortunate, her) to stop listening to scientists with an agenda. Let's keep America moving forward.
0xFC0944E5=想象一下——室外37度，你还得走路去上班。没有机会坐在舒适的SUV里吹着空调等堵车，没有机会听你上早班时最爱听的WKTT电台。更糟的是，你要坐在臭气冲天的地铁上，和一群没素质的挖脸抠脚移民挤在一起，听他们叨叨「天诛美国」。一旦自由派新起草的全球变暖应对法案通过，这就是我们的未来。或许其他第一世界国家都听信了科学家的谎言，但我们还没有。赶紧打电话找你所在选区的众议员，告诉他(女议员也凑合着说吧)别听那些别有用心的科学家的鬼话了。
