;0x104538F5=Jayvon Simson's body was one of the many collected by coroners in Algonquin recently. It wasn't a knife or a gun or a rocket launcher that killed this man though... he was killed by video games. Witnesses report a heated argument outside Videogeddon arcade, an establishment where addicts pump quarters into computers to get their fix of horrific violence. The argument was followed by a chase on motorbikes then his grizzly murder. It is no surprise that upset community leaders are pointing to games as the cause of this death; the pattern of altercation, vehicle chase, murder, rebirth and try again is common in video games. Although Mr. Simson was a known drug user and dealer with several convictions, we are certain this case is due to polygons and pixels not parole boards.
0x104538F5=Jayvon Simson的尸体是是Algonquin验尸官最近收集的众多尸体之一。但是凶器却不是刀、枪或火箭发射器...他被电子游戏杀死了。目击者称，在「Videogeddon」游戏厅外发生了一场激烈的争吵。在这一游戏厅内，瘾君子们将自己对暴力的渴望发泄在电脑上。而争吵之后是骑摩托车的追逐，然后是他灰暗的死亡。也难怪社群领袖都认为电子游戏是凶杀案的诱因；在电子游戏中，争吵、车辆追逐、杀人、重生再来的模式很常见。虽然Simson先生是个有名的吸毒者和贩毒者，数罪在身，但我们可以肯定，这个案件是由于多边形和像素引起的，而不是因为假释委员会。

;0x8EE19541=Some of us never have successful resolution of the Oedipus Complex, a situation that turned deadly in Rotterdam Hill. Joshua Hampton, age 6 months, was arrested by police after a neighbor called in a report of strange noises at the apartment next door. Police found the body of Abraham Hampton, 31, stuffed under a baby changing station in their Rotterdam Hill apartment and, just like Laius and Jocasta, Joshua and his mother were already planning their wedding.

;0xA7E0AEF8=The renovation of the Libertonian continues. Not content with having donated a wing, Lyle Cleethorpes, of the famous labor-trading and sweatshop-owning family, has donated workers on his payroll to assist the renovation process. Cleethorpes said, "Any end to speed this process is worth it. I remember walking through this museum as a child and thinking what a great testament to mankind it would be if my name were on every wing of the place. I donated all of my "helpers" because it's such a shame that no one can see the splendor of our wing and marvel at what our family has achieved." This city only survives because of the generosity of philanthropists like Lyle Cleethorpes.
0xA7E0AEF8=对自由城博物馆的翻修还在继续。而捐赠了一个侧厅的Lyle Cleethorpes并不满足于此，Lyle Cleethorpes的家族是著名的劳工贸易公司，拥有血汗工厂 ，因此他还捐助了在公司名单的工人们来协助翻修工程。Cleethorpes说：「为了翻修的早日完成，我所做的一切都是值得的。记得当我还是一个孩子的时候，走过这个博物馆，我就想着：『如果我的大名能够刻在这里的每个展厅上，这将会是对人们很好的证明。』我捐赠了我所有的『帮手』，因为如果没有人看得到我们所捐赠的厅室之辉煌、没有人惊叹于我们家族之成就，我会觉得羞愧。」这座城市之所以幸存下来，就是因为有Lyle Cleethorpes这样的慈善家的慷慨吧。
