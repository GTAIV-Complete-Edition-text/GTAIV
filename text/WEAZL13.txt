;0x04913B40=It used to be about hitting her over the head with a club and dragging her back to your cave. Then it was about meeting her at the square dance. Then it was about doing blow with her in a bar until you had a drunken fumble outside. Now it is about online dating - it's the craze that has taken over Liberty City and the whole of America with people learning how to say "you don't look much like your photo" in a thousand different ways and discovering that when a stranger calls, it's not always a fairy tale. Some government officials worry that this rise in the virtual world and online matchmaking is about more than assuaging basic human loneliness. They believe it is about destabilizing the American family and letting terrorists into our country through the back door.
0x04913B40=过去的约会，男人们先是用棒球棍把女人打晕然后把她拖回自己的洞穴，后来就是和她一起广场舞，再然后就是让她给你在酒吧的小角落里口交直到喝醉后全身上下摸个遍。现在的约会则是通过网络——这一潮流已经席卷自由城，甚至全美的人们都在学着拐着弯说：你和照片上长得不太像，当大家和他们的网恋对象通话时，他们发现遇见的并不都是童话。一些政府官员担心，虚拟世界的这种发展和网上配对的影响不会止步于减轻人们的孤独感。他们相信这会瓦解美国的家庭，让恐怖分子从后门进入美国。

;0x0FB28553=By the time a person hits the age of 25, they have been molested at least 3 times say local officials. The problem is the Internet. For every college girl, there are 18 predators - often young men who will stop at nothing to contact them, chat, and lure them to study after school or go to a concert. But the intentions are not about studying at all says Health and Human Services Director, Thomas Piretta.
0x0FB28553=当一个人25岁的时候，他们至少被人猥亵了三次，比如当地官员。而问题的根源就是互联网。每一个女大学生都有18个人紧紧追猎着她——大多是无所顾忌地联系她们、和她们聊天、诱惑她们放学后继续学习或者去听音乐会的年轻男性。但他们的企图完全不是学习。Health and Human Services的主任Thomas Piretta如是说道。

;0x1DF821DE="These predators will make contact outside school, or even inside the school, and ask the girl to come over to their house or to a party where there is potentially alcohol served. The boys have one thing in mind - to get into those tight pants as soon as possible. They sit and just froth at the thought of that hot little tight red thong underwear. Uhhhh! It's, It's, horrible!" said Piretta.
0x1DF821DE=「这些追求者们会在校外甚至在校内和女生联系，并且邀请她们去他们家里做客，或者去可能有酒精饮料供应的派对玩一玩。这些男生只想着一件事——尽快进入那些女生紧裹着的内裤。他们坐在那儿想着射在女生红色的丁字裤上。呕，这真是，太恶心了！」Piretta这样说。

;0x3079A77C=One government official who declined to be named for fear of "rocking the liberal apple cart" noted, "The rise in the popularity of online dating is proof that our enemies are winning. We should go back to old fashioned ways of meeting women, such as arranged marriages and barn building competitions. I've been divorced twice because I married the wrong women. The fact is; you shouldn't let a computer pick your wife. Computers are good for certain tasks, like aiming bombs, but not other ones, like raising kids. Every time someone finds happiness through a computer date, terrorism has won another battle." <a href="www.love-meet.net">Love-meet.net</a> and <a href="www.craplist.net">craplist.net</a> had no comment on the matter.
0x3079A77C=一名害怕「打乱自由派的美梦」而不愿透露姓名的政府官员称：「网上约会现象的兴起是我们敌人正在胜利的证据。我们得回归传统的约见女人的方式，比如包办婚姻和比赛建造谷仓。我离了两次婚，因为我没有遇见对的人。事实上，你就不该让电脑为你挑选对象。电脑在一些方面确实很厉害，比如扔炸弹的时候瞄准目标，但是电脑抚养可不能抚养小孩子。人们每通过网上约会找到一次幸福，恐怖主义就赢了一次战役。<a href="www.love-meet.net">Love-meet.net</a> and <a href="www.craplist.net">craplist.net</a> 对于此事不做评论。
