;0x360AE814=The Liberty Tree goes 2.0 with a whole new business plan. In light of the recent report by the National Library Center that the net generation does not read books or newspapers unless they are online, the publishers of the Liberty Tree are planning to cease the newsprint version of the paper by 2010. Readers will still be able to read their news stories online via wireless mobile devices and high-speed internet connections and blog and call each other names and be assholes on message boards. "This really is the future. It's 2.0. It's interactive. Paper books and newsprint will be phased out by the end of the decade. Ebooks and web news are the future. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to a webinar," said associate publisher, Louis Fertinatta, on his new blog, which he started because some 22-year-old prick in marketing told him it was essential to the future, man.
0x360AE814=伴随着全新的商业计划，Liberty Tree迎来2.0版。根据国家图书馆中心最新的一段报告，互联网一代只会在网络上读书看报，Liberty Tree出版社计划在2010年前停用报纸的纸质版。读者仍然可以通过无线移动设备、高速的互联网玩博客、阅读新闻报道、联系彼此、在留言板里当键盘侠 「这就是未来。这就是2.0。它是交互式的。纸质书籍和纸质报纸将在本世纪末逐步淘汰。电子书和在线新闻是未来。先失陪一下，我得去参加一个网络研讨会了，」 副出版商Louis Fertinatta在他的新博客上说道，而他开始写博客是因为22岁的营销专家告诉他：「这对未来至关重要。」

;0x3BEFD019=Several members of the local Liberty City union for construction workers were massacred on a building site today. The site had been shut down because of disagreements with the property developer, Yusuf Amir, that resulted in a strike. No one is sure what caused the altercation but the union, which was long alleged to have links with organized crime, seems to have had several heavily armed delegates at the site.
