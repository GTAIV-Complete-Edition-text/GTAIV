;0xB9D25873=It's tough being a godless liberal in a theocracy, but it's about to get even worse if Congress has its way. "Everyone should be able to get married," says Phil Kensington of the American Society of Same Sex, "I want to marry my life partner, who is a 79 year old man, but very wealthy, and I am 26 and love to club and we have a great time. If we don't marry, how can I ride this old git for a couple of years, cringing every time he slobbers on me and calls it a kiss, just so I can take his millions?"
0xB9D25873=在一个神权政体中，成为一个无神论的自由主义者很难，但如果国会执意这样行事，情况将变得更糟。「每个人都应该能够结婚，」 美国同性恋协会的Phil Kensington说「我想和我的终身伴侣结婚，他79岁了，但是很富有。而我26岁，喜欢去夜店，我们在一起很开心。要是我们不结婚，我怎么会骑这老家伙好几年、每次他管对我流口水的行为叫亲吻就巴结他，然后拿走他的百万家产呢？」
