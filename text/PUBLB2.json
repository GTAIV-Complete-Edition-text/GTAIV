With the renewal of the Jingoism Act, EVERY SINGLE THING YOU DO will be monitored. There are 300 million people in America and a reported 300 million people will need to be hired to track the every movement of every American. These are scary times and I am so glad to be a liberal journalist who doesn't interject her personal feelings into stories. The blogosphere is the only thing that can save us from this tyranny.",
