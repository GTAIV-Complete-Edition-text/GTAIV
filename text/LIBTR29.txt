;0x43A8E8D5=N.O.O.S.E representatives are blaming terrorists for a massive explosion at a fueling depot in Northwood earlier, however not everyone is convinced. Having been criticized for their failure to tackle the rise in organized crime, some say this may be an attempt to divert attention. Those killed in the blast were known associates of the Ancelotti crime family and the warehouse itself was owned by Anthony "Tony Black" Spoleto, a senior Ancelotti capo also killed in the attack.
0x43A8E8D5=N.O.O.S.E的代表人指出，早些时候发生在Northwood燃料库的大规模爆炸是一次恐怖行动，但人们认为N.O.O.S.E在此次事件中也应负起责任。有人指责N.O.O.S.E对城里居高不下犯罪率没有压制力，有的人则指出他们可能只是在转移公众的视线。失事名单中有黑手党Ancelotti家族中的名人。这间仓库属于Ancelotti家族的一名高级头目，人称「Tony Black」的Anthony Spoleto，而他本人也在本次袭击中丧生。

;0xE0DD85EB=Diminutive playboy and internet millionaire, Tony McTony, today announced plans to sue LC24 magazine because they had referred to him as Napoleonic. The bling-wearing little man is, he claims, five foot three. Napoleon, his lawyer points out, was only five foot two. Plus Mr. McTony objects to the idea that he has any complexes. He commented, "I am a complex man, but I aint got no complex - why should I when I am perfect? Complexes is for people who want to sleep with their mommas. I mean, I love my moms, but I never went there." We will keep you posted on developments down there.
0xE0DD85EB=身材短小的花花公子、网络巨人Tony McTony，在今日宣称他计划起诉LC24杂志，因为他们称他为拿破仑。这位穿得金光闪闪的短小男士，声称他身长五英尺三英寸，而他的律师指出拿破仑身长仅五英尺二英寸。McTony比拿破仑整整高了一寸，所以说他像拿破仑是对他的诽谤。另外，McTony先生对于有关他本人具有的一些「情结」的说法表示反对，他说：「我是一个难懂的人，但是我并没有任何『情结』，我这么个完美的人，还要什么『情结』？『情结』是那些想睡他妈的人才会有的。我不是说我不爱我的母亲，但我还没到那种程度。」我们会为您持续报导后续内容。

;0xE114A3A6=While the target's mob links may just be a coincidence, sources close to the Liberty Tree suggest it is much more likely that Tony Black was hit because he acted as a conduit between the Ancelottis and the Albanian street gang they use as muscle. Either the street gang wanted to be taken more seriously and eliminated their employer, or another mafia family decided to take out the competition. Terrorists are not known for sticking around long enough to give their victims two in the back of the head, are they? Whether hitmen or terrorists blew up the warehouse, residents of Liberty City can be sure of one thing - this city is not safe.
0xE114A3A6=黑手党家族的头目刚好死于本次恐怖袭击，可能仅仅只是一个巧合，但有来自Liberty Tree的消息称，Tony Black很可能是被蓄意谋杀的，因为他本人充当了家族内部和家族名下阿尔巴尼亚人的街头帮派之间的中间人。要么是这个帮派想受到重视便杀了现在的雇主，要么是另外一个黑手党家族想挑起战争。如果只是为去给受害者们脑后来两发，恐怖分子们可不会准备那么久，难道不是吗？然而不管炸毁仓库的是杀手还是恐怖分子，自由城的居民可以肯定一件事——这个城市并不安全。
