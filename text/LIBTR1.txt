;0x0843DFE4=Reacting to angry citizens' groups claiming that police brutality is on the rise, Liberty City's Police Commissioner for Public Affairs, Tom Pireni, told reporters, "Our police are here to make you feel safe. Sometimes you are acting in an unsafe manner or not standing in a designated free speech zone, at which point we have to take action quickly and violently."
0x0843DFE4=许多愤怒的民间组织宣称暴力执法事件持续增多，作为回应，LCPD公共事务处处长Tom Pireni告诉记者：「我们警察是来给予你们安全感的。不过偶尔各位的行为不太安全，或者超出了给定的言论自由，我们就只能采取迅速暴力的措施。」

;0x0A1E51B3=Citing increased chatter by known terrorists, officials raised the threat level to Magenta 5 and have closed many bridges in the metropolitan area causing havoc for commuters and forcing many to lose their jobs and contemplate selling their bodies to make up for lost income. Officials speaking on the condition of anonymity said that, while they don't speak Arabic, the chit chat they heard was something like "slalom" which rhymes with "dirty bomb."
0x0A1E51B3=鉴于恐怖分子持续传播恐慌，官员将威胁等级提升至紫红色级(5级)，并封锁了市中心一带的大量桥梁。这是通勤族的灾难，不少人已因此丢了工作，只得考虑卖身填补收入缺口。一位不愿透露姓名的政府官员表示，他们从传言中听到的词是「红砖」，跟「脏弹」押韵。

;0x1214F386=After a major scuffle at the Broker Bridge earlier, citizens lined up, showing welts, bruises and bullet wounds from what they say is a macho police force gone seriously overboard. Some passersby had other opinions. "You Americans bring this upon yourself," Natalya Shironova told Weazel Radio, "When we fix elections, all dissenters are rounded up and sent to salt mines. It soon stops anyone from complaining."
0x1214F386=在先前Broker桥发生的大型冲突发生后，市民们一字排开，展露了身上的红肿、淤青以及枪伤。他们称这些伤痕是由一群彪悍的警察部队过度执法所致。一些路人则抱有截然相反的看法，「都是你们美国人自己作孽，」Natalya Shitonova对Weazel电台说，「我们那儿操纵选举的时候会把反对者集中在一起，送去挖盐。一下子就没人抱怨了。」

;0x1FDB7D2D=Police Lieutenant Chuck Montresse said, "This is what the terrorists want - they want us to be afraid. So, just to be cautious, we're going to be shit-scared, shut down the bridges and show them that freedom will always win."
0x1FDB7D2D=Chuck Montresse警长说：「这正是恐怖分子想要的——让我们恐惧。所以，谨慎起见，我们就该被吓出屎来，只能封锁桥梁，让他们知道自由必胜。」

;0xC445D556=However, police brutality and corruption have dogged his time in office. There are also allegations of statistical tampering. Lawyer Tom Goldberg has pointed out that the high conviction rate comes from the clearing of so called "cold cases" after examination with new forensic evidence, "Mayor Ochoa and the Liberty City PD are using statistics to blind the people as to the true nature of life on the streets of this city. It's dangerous - your children are not safe."
0xC445D556=然而，警方暴力执法和腐败问题仍困扰着他。也有人揭发数据造假。律师Tom Goldberg指出，高结案率源于通过新的法医证据解决的「陈年旧案」，「Ochoa市长和自由城警局正在用统计数据蒙蔽人们的双眼，和他们掩盖本市街头治安真实情况的行为如出一辙。这很危险，你们的孩子没有安全可言。」

;0xD3D8747B=Idealistic Liberty City Mayor, Julio Ochoa, vowed to rid our city's streets of illegal firearms yesterday, "Our gun laws are in place for a reason. It is my duty as Mayor to enforce those laws - whether that means prosecuting the thugs possessing weapons here in Liberty City, or the salespeople providing those weapons out of state." Mayor Ochoa's task force has launched cases against Ammu-Nation stores as far a field as Los Santos and Vice City. The mayor boasts of low crime rates in the city and a high murder conviction rate.
0xD3D8747B=理想主义的自由城市长，Julio Ochoa于昨日发誓，要根除本市街头的非法枪支弹药：「我们的控枪法律是有必要存在的。作为市长，我有义务强化这些法律，无论是要起诉本市持有武器的暴徒，还是起诉来自其他州的武器贩子，我都在所不辞。」Ochoa市长的专门工作组已对远在洛圣都和罪城的武装国度商店提起诉讼。市长以本市的低犯罪率和高谋杀案结案率为荣。

;0xF5F338B4=Last year over 10,000 illegal firearms were recovered by the LCPD. There were over 500 gun-related homicides. Is Ochoa's campaign a case of too little, too late? Will his jaunts to sunnier cities save our children from their almost certain fates? The sale or possession of firearms is illegal here, in Liberty City. Does that mean that weapons are only in the hands of people willing to use them for evil? It remains to be seen.
0xF5F338B4=去年LCPD收回了超过一万支非法枪械。超过500起涉枪谋杀于去年发生。Ochoa的行动是否会收效甚微，为时过晚？他到阳光更好的城市进行考察，能否让孩子们摆脱几乎注定的命运？在自由城，贩卖或持有枪支弹药是违法的。这是否意味着，武器只会出现在愿意用其作恶的人手中？让我们拭目以待。
