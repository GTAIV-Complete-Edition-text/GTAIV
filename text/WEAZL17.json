And the four horses of the beast will come down and lay ravage to the land if the Fed doesn't spring into action immediately. Investors shrugged off the 896 trillion dollars owed in debt by the US and got a fresh injection of 85 billion into securities markets aimed at lubricating mortgage losses. Honestly, this financial market shit is wicked fucking boring and I wish I could write for the style section or about hip hop, homey.",
