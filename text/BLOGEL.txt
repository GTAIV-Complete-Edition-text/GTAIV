;0x018BB456=That man in the pet shop is beautiful, in an unfathomable way.
0x018BB456=宠物店里的那个男人竟该死的甜美。

;0x0947D4BA=Eddie went to take out some money from a bank today. Actually, from a banker. I cut it out of his pocket in the elevator. He had a nice face. I will go and wait for him tomorrow. I found some photos of Eddie in his little sailor's outfit earlier!!! Oh, how Eddie wanted to be a sailor!!! Then they locked me up in that camp for bad boys. Now it's just me alone in the world. And mother. Is that you, mother? No, it's just Eddie in mother's underwear. Bad Eddie. Such a bad little boy.
0x0947D4BA=今天Eddie去银行取了点钱，实际上，是从银行家身上取的。我在电梯里从他的口袋里掏出来的。他有一张漂亮的脸，我明天会去等着他。之前我在Eddie的水手服中找到了一些照片！！！啊，Eddie多想成为一名水手！！！然后他们把我关在那个坏男孩的营地里，现在只有我一个人在世界上。妈妈，那是你吗，妈妈？不，那只是穿着妈妈内衣的Eddie。坏Eddie，真是个坏孩子。

;0x188E19F0=Eddie's big Saturday night in: 1 bottle of sweet sherry. Check. Neighbor's puppy. Check. Floor sander. Check.
0x188E19F0=Eddie周六晚上的大计划：一瓶甜雪莉酒，完成。邻居的小狗，完成。地板砂光机，完成。

;0x340BD0EB=Half a pint of bourbon,
0x340BD0EB=半品脱波旁威士忌，

;0x3543A956=Still no friends on MyRoom. And I made a real effort to be approachable in my profile as well. People don't get Eddie and Eddie doesn't get people. Eddie had a girlfriend once. He kept her in the cellar. In fact, she must still be down there. Maybe it's because I'm an only child. Well, I am now, anyway. They found Eddie's brother in the pond. WHEN WILL THAT TAP STOP DRIPPING????????????????????????? Drip, drip, drip. I can feel the itch starting again; the itch that has to be scratched. I MUST GET STRONGER. You think Eddie's invisible, do you? You think you can just look at your feet and walk on by? Nobody listens to Eddie. But you will. You will hear my silence and feel my breath. Je suis un monstre.
0x3543A956=在MyRoom上还是没好友。虽然在我的个人资料里，我已经努力让自己显得平易近人。人们不理解Eddie，Eddie也不理解他们。Eddie有过一个女朋友，他把她关在地下室里。事实上，她一定还在那儿。也许是因为我是独生子吧。不管怎样，现在我是了。他们在池塘里找到Eddie的弟弟。那个傻逼水龙头啥时候才能消停?????????????????????????滴，滴，滴个不停。我又开始感觉到痒了；那种不挠就不行的痒。我必须更强大。你觉得Eddie什么也不是，是吗？你觉得你能低头走过去吗？没人听Eddie的，但你会，你会听见我的沉默，感受到我的呼吸。我是怪物。

;0x51958BFE=Pop! goes the abdomen.
0x51958BFE=砰！胃跑了。

;0x573F72C7=Such a horrible way for mother to die. How could someone do such a thing? They tried to say that Eddie did it but I was too clever. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT CAT DOING NOW!!! Why would Eddie ever want to keep his mother's breasts in a shoebox under the bed, officer? I can wrap the police round my little finger. I have some vocal cords wrapped around my little finger right now. Not so chatty now, are you, my love? That silly girl at the hardware store. Smiling at Eddie when he bought the chicken wire. Smiling at Eddie when he bought the duct tape. All Eddie wanted to do was nurse on her but she had to play hard to get. Games. Always games. I've got a game for you. FIND YOUR EYES. How can it be 4pm? Time for bed. When did Eddie last sleep? It takes Eddie so long to go to bed. So many rituals...
0x573F72C7=母亲以如此可怕的方式死去。怎么会有人做这样的事呢？他们想说是Eddie干的，但我太聪明了。那只猫他妈的现在在干什么！！！为什么Eddie要把他妈妈的乳房藏在床底下的鞋盒里，警官?我能轻而易举地对付警察。现在我的小指上缠着一些声带，你现在不那么爱说话了吧，亲爱的?那个在五金店的傻妞，Eddie买铁丝网时，她对他笑了；当Eddie买了胶带时，她对他笑了。Eddie只想照顾她，但她必须装出难以接近的样子。游戏，总是游戏。我有个游戏给你：找到你的眼睛。怎么可能是下午4点？该睡觉了。Eddie上次睡觉是什么时候？Eddie花了这么长时间才上床睡觉，仪式太多了...

;0x5C7BF9EA=It's time for me to speak to the world. To tell you who I am. To be famous, like I will be. I thought that the Internets were just for buying breast milk but I'm learning that they're so much more. All these millions of shadowy figures jostling for visibility. Are you alone in the dark waiting for Eddie? I'm finally starting to feel part of something; that I'm wired into a cosmos, a COMMUNITY. Eddie's never had any friends, except for Boo Boo Wilkins. I hate that cat. I hate that cat. I hate that cat. Always wailing and whining and wanting to be petted. I'll pet you, Boo Boo Wilkins - with a fucking cheese grater!!!!!! NO! Eddie would never hurt Boo Boo Wilkins.
0x5C7BF9EA=现在是我向全世界发表演讲的时候了，告诉你我是谁。想出名，就像我一样。我原以为网络只是用来买母乳的，但我发现它们的功能远不止这些。数以百万计的模糊的身影在四处乱撞，渴望被看到。你一个人在黑暗中等Eddie吗？我终于开始感觉到自己是某个事物的一部分；我被连接到一个宇宙，一个社区。除了Boo Boo Wilkins，Eddie从来没有任何朋友。我讨厌那只猫。我讨厌那只猫。我讨厌那只猫。总是哭哭啼啼，想要被爱抚。我要抚摸你，Boo Boo Wilkins——用他妈的奶酪刨丝器！！！！！不！Eddie永远不会伤害Boo Boo Wilkins。

;0x5EECA6AC=Mix it up and make it nice,
0x5EECA6AC=搅拌它让它看起来更好，

;0x6AB31658=Boo Boo Wilkins never made Eddie grow his hair long and wear a dress to school. Where is father now? Sleeping, Eddie, sleeping. I set up a MyRoom page yesterday but nobody has contacted me for anal sex yet. I saw a documentary about it on TV. I don't watch a lot of tv. Mother never allowed it. Just cartoons and wildlife programs.
0x6AB31658=Boo Boo Wilkins从不让Eddie留长发，也不让他穿裙子去上学。爸爸现在在哪里？睡觉，Eddie，睡觉。我昨天建立了我的MyRoom页面，但是还没有人联系我进行肛交。我在电视上看了一部关于它的纪录片。我不怎么看电视，因为母亲从不允许，除了卡通片和野生动物节目。

;0x77E0A8A3=Oh, how it smells in here. You've got to clean the house. DO YOUR CHORES!!! Nasty, nasty Eddie.
0x77E0A8A3=哦，这里的气味真难闻。你必须打扫房子。做你的家务！！！肮脏、龌龊的Eddie。

;0x81822FB7=Eddie slept in the garden last night. Oh, what fun! What delightful fun! Under the apple tree. Then the birds starting chirping, drilling into my head with their messages of doom and subversion. I remember playing in that tree as a boy. Little Eddie with his little peanut. Look at Low! It's like a maggot! How I hated those showers. So many schools, so many showers, so many people to find. Remember me, Pennington? Remember me, Owens? Remember me, Dodson? Eddie is all grown up now and wants to show you what he knows about musculoskeletal manipulation. The itch is getting worse. What day is it? Tuesday? Friday? Is it fish today, mother? Must get out for a wander. Scratch that itch.
0x81822FB7=Eddie昨晚睡在花园里。哦，多么有趣！多么令人愉快！在苹果树下。然后鸟儿开始叽叽喳喳，带着它们厄运和颠覆的信息钻进我的脑袋。我记得小时候在那棵树上玩。小Eddie和他的小花生。看看我！就像蛆一样！我多么讨厌那些阵雨。这么多的学校，这么多的阵雨，这么多人要去寻找。记得我吗，Pennington？记得我吗，Owens？记得我，Dodson？Eddie现在已经长大了，他想让你看看他对肌肉骨骼操作的了解。痒得更厉害了。今天星期几？星期二吗？星期五吗？妈妈，今天是钓鱼日吗？必须要出去闲逛了。挠痒。

;0x87FA92AE=The thought of you reading my weblog is quite a turn-on I can tell you. Trust me, it's not true. I make it all up, just like they make up where little boys and little girls come from. Lots of things turn me on - trepanation, armadillos, yeast infections - but I have to learn to control myself. Mother caught Eddie pumping devil paste out of his peanut one day and made me sleep in the dog kennel. I never liked that dog. The way it looked at me when I made it lick jam off my peanut. Those judging eyes. I made a finger puppet out of its esophagus. Nobody has contacted me on MyRoom yet. I just want to meet a nice girl. Or a boy. Where was Eddie tonight? Why am I in mother's nightgown?
0x87FA92AE=我可以告诉你，一想到你读我的博客，我就很兴奋。相信我，这不是真的，这一切都是我编造的，就像他们编造小男孩和小女孩从哪里来一样。很多事情都让我兴奋——环锯术、犰狳、酵母菌感染——但我必须学会控制自己。有一天，妈妈发现Eddie把「花生」里可怖的「浆糊」抽了出来，让我睡在狗窝里。我从不喜欢那条狗。当我让它舔掉「花生」上的「浆糊」时，它看着我的样子，那是审判的眼神。我用它的食道做了一个手指木偶。还没有人联系过我的MyRoom。我只是想认识一个好女孩，或一个男孩。Eddie今晚去哪了？为什么我穿着妈妈的睡衣？

;0x887379B9=Eddie made a joke. Eddie made a joke. Oh no, now Eddie made a poo poo.
0x887379B9=Eddie开了个玩笑，Eddie开了个玩笑。哦不，Eddie拉了泡大便。

;0xA10925B2=That Detective Atkinson is a moron. He'll never catch me. He can't even come up with a name for me. All he's interested in is getting his picture in the newspaper. I'm supposed to be the one getting the attention! Everybody thinks they can ignore Eddie. Well, maybe I am invisible. Maybe you can't see me. But another head is looking me straight in the eye right now. This is just the beginning, Atkinson. Complacency. Apathy. Indulgence. Is this what humanity has come to? Is this the civilization for which man was destined? If so, I don't want to be part of it. The gene pool is polluted. You do not deserve life. You make me want to puke. In fact, I'm going to.
0xA10925B2=警探Atkinson是一个白痴。他永远抓不住我。他甚至没法给我起个名字。他唯一感兴趣的就是在报纸上登他的照片。我应该是那个引起注意的人！每个人都认为他们可以忽略Eddie，也许我是隐形的，也许你看不到我。但现在另一个人正直视着我的眼睛。这只是个开始，Atkinson。自满，冷漠，放纵，这就是人类的现状吗？这就是人类命中注定的文明吗？如果是这样，我不想参与其中。基因库被污染了。你不值得活下去，你让我想吐。事实上，我打算这么做。 

;0xA5AAFC86=Eddie is happy today. And when I say happy, I mean empty and numb, like you are supposed to feel when the drugs kick in. I dressed up Boo Boo Wilkins like a baby and he licked gravy off my nipple. He's the luckiest cat in the whole wide world. What is that smell? Granny? Not on the mouth, PLEASE granny. How nice Eddie's hands are! Long, smooth fingers like a pianist. Eddie used to play the oboe until he lost it up the rectum of a park ranger. Back in the good old days before they all went away.
0xA5AAFC86=Eddie今天很高兴。当我说快乐的时候，我指的是空虚和麻木，就像你在吸毒时的感觉一样。我把Boo Boo Wilkins打扮得像个婴儿，他舔掉了我乳头上的肉汁。它是世界上最幸运的猫。那是什么味道？奶奶？请不要放在嘴边，奶奶。Eddie的手多好啊！长而光滑的手指像钢琴家。Eddie吹双簧管，直到他在公园管理员的直肠里把它弄丢了。回到他们都走之前的美好时光。

;0xA8010136=Eddie went out to play again earlier. Bad Eddie. Another zit on the back of society has been popped. He looked troubled, then startled, then quiet. His balls are in a glass next to my bed. My freezer is getting very full. Time for one of Eddie's famous casseroles. Boo Boo Wilkins loves Eddie's casseroles.
0xA8010136=Eddie早些时候又出去玩了。糟糕的Eddie。又一个社会问题出现了。他看上去先是不安，然后是吃惊，最后是安静。他的蛋蛋在我床边的玻璃杯里。我的冰箱快满了。Eddie著名的「砂锅菜」来了。Boo Boo Wilkins喜欢Eddie做的砂锅菜。

;0xC3AD4B93=Eddie has been a naughty boy. I only went for a walk by the river, mother, I promise. There's a jogger in the bushes. I HATE JOGGERS!! You are given the greatest gift of all - life - and what do you do with it? Jog. Fucking narcissists! LOOK AT ME. Look at me lunge and stretch. Look at me hopping in place while I wait for the lights to change. Oooooh, I'm not going to run, I'm not going to walk - I'm going to JOG. Get off the fucking fence before I impale you on it. Ooops, I already have. I brought the head back for Boo Boo Wilkins but he isn't impressed. That cat has got ideas too big for its britches. I like to cut the heads off joggers to see if they keep on running, like chickens. Sometimes the only difference between making love and making hate is a turn of the wrist. So tired...
0xC3AD4B93=Eddie是个淘气的男孩。我只是去河边散步，妈妈，我保证。灌木丛里有一个慢跑者。我讨厌慢跑者！！你被赋予了生命中最伟大的礼物，你会怎么做呢？慢跑。他妈的自恋！看着我。看着我弓步和伸展。看着我在等待灯光变化的同时跳来跳去。我不打算跑，我不打算走——我打算慢跑。在我把你刺穿之前，快从这该死的栅栏上下来。哦，我已经这么干了。我把它的头带回来给Boo Boo Wilkins，但他不以为然。那只猫太自大了。我喜欢砍掉慢跑者的头，看看他们是否能像小鸡一样继续奔跑。有时候，制造爱和制造恨的唯一区别就是手腕的转动。太累了...

;0xCAC87930=That's better. I'll clean it up later. Will you Eddie, will you?
0xCAC87930=这样更好。我待会儿清理。你会吗Eddie，会吗？

;0xD14ECEC3=Boo Boo Wilkins has ruined my day again. That cat is more devious than I ever imagined. I can see ridicule in its eyes - the animal actually believes that it is superior to me in some way. Must be terrible being a eunuch but that's what happens when you decide that the litter tray is optional. Eddie pooped in the litter tray once. It's not so bad.
0xD14ECEC3=Boo Boo Wilkins又毁了我的一天。那只猫比我想像的还要狡猾。我可以在它的眼睛里看到嘲笑——这只动物实际上认为它在某种程度上优于我。被阉割一定很可怕，但是当你确定猫砂盆是可选的时，会发生这种情况。Eddie有一次在猫砂盆里大便。也不是那么坏。

;0xD3750FBB=Half a pound of basmati rice,
0xD3750FBB=半磅印度香米，

;0xE3B68B6E=Eddie, you really must clean up that diarrhea!!!
0xE3B68B6E=Eddie，你真的必须把腹泻物清理干净了！！！

;0xE7E690C1=That's all for now now. Time for Eddie to nurse on his prosthetic breast.
0xE7E690C1=现在就这些。Eddie该用假乳房喂奶了。

;0xF1EEB4CF=Nobody enters the house. EVER. Except for Boo Boo Wilkins, of course. Here kitty kitty. He killed a bird today and I ejaculated. Bad Eddie. I rubbed lemon juice on my peanut like Mother told me to. I stay in the house and I am alone; I go outside and all I see are imbeciles. Pointless morons treading water in a stagnant pool of mediocrity. Breeding, multiplying. Evolution has been halted and we are in regression. The human race is in decline. But Eddie gave natural selection another helping hand today. I left a present for you in a sports bag, Detective Atkinson! Another diseased soul vaccinated with a blow torch and a trowel. DO YOU SEE ME NOW??!! Fate is always around the corner, next door, a heartbeat away. Watching, whispering, waiting.
0xF1EEB4CF=没人进屋。永远。当然，除了Boo Boo Wilkins。这只小猫咪，他今天杀了一只鸟，我射精了。坏Eddie。我按母亲的吩咐把柠檬汁涂在「花生」上。我呆在家里，只有我一个人；我走到外面，看到的都是低能儿，毫无意义的笨蛋在平庸的停滞不前的池子里踩水。繁衍，生息，进化已经停止，我们正在倒退。人类正在衰退。但是今天Eddie又帮了自然选择一把，我在运动包里给你留了份礼物，Atkinson警探！另一个患病的灵魂被用喷灯和泥刀接种。你现在看到我了吗？？！！命运即将到来，下一扇门，一个心跳的距离。注视着，低语着，等待着。
