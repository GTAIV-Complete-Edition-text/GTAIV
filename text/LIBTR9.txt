;0x800C450E=Bryce Dawkins attempted to diffuse the homophobic row that is threatening to engulf city hall in a firestorm of hatred yesterday when he said that his vicious attack on our city's gay community was "misunderstood, misquoted and misappropriated." In a strange attempt to pour oil on troubled waters, Dawkins said, "This kind of thing is a distraction from what really matters - fighting crime and fighting terrorism." He added that his job was "to make people safe, not make friends with everyone." Gay rights groups and civil rights protestors refused to accept the semi-apology saying it was typical gibberish spoken by a man who deserves to be impeached.
0x800C450E=Bryce Dawkins昨天表示，他对同性恋者的仇恨攻击「完全被误解，被错误引用，十分不恰当。」试图借此疏散那些威胁要让市政厅充满仇恨之火的仇同者。而后Dawkins为平息事件作出了迷惑发言：「这种事都是障眼法，意在让我们忽视真正的关键，即与犯罪分子和恐怖主义斗争。」他又补充道自己的工作是「让人们安全，而不是与所有人交朋友。」同性恋权利组织和人权组织的示威者拒绝接受这种半吊子的谢罪，他们说会说这种疯话的人都活该被弹劾。
