;0x28C50ADA=This change in strategy makes the already fraught task of naming the serial killer much more difficult. Police are baffled about this dangerous turn of events, while the city lives in dread. One Dukes resident noted, "What does it say about our police department that they can't even name a serial killer? What must the Midwest think of us now? It's pathetic. The police chief should be beheaded, never mind these poor victims."
0x28C50ADA=连环杀手改变了作案方式，让警方更加难以对他命名。警方被这一危险的事态转变难住，整个城市也陷入恐慌。一位来自Dukes的居民表示：「连名字都取不出来的警察局到底有什么用？这下我们要被中西部的人当什么了？真是可悲。警局局长就该被斩首，他根本不在乎可怜的受害者。」

;0x9A216D91=Liberty City's serial killer struck again yesterday with the news that the body of a man had been recovered who'd had his limbs and genitals removed. This time, however, unlike other victims, the head remained intact. The victim was a white male, although police have not yet released a name.

;0x9A649F59=We could not reach a member of The Lost Motorcycle Club for comment but a spokesperson for the Angels of Death denied any member involvement in this altercation. He claimed that they are, "just a bunch of guys who like to get together, get drunk and then ride choppers. We keep our noses clean." If lines of methamphetamine have a sanitizing effect, then this guy might be right.

;0xB7D47268=A Lawyer, Tom Goldberg, was murdered in his high security Algonquin office today. Mr. Goldberg was believed to be engaged in pursuing corruption charges against high ranking members of the LCPD along with several members of City Hall. Previously, Mr. Goldberg had been involved in cases against the mafia, class action suits against food companies and also won a case against the Strike Lite match company for failing to put a warning on their matches that the product could cause fire if used correctly. In a moment of hubris, he also unsuccessfully sued God for letting it rain on his parade. The killer gained entrance to the offices of Goldberg, Ligner and Shyster where Mr. Goldberg was a partner. Dick Shyster, another partner in the firm, eulogized Mr. Goldberg in a press release, "Tom will be sorely missed by all the people he got off. I'll be taking over a lot of his cases, so hopefully I'll get a media profile as big as his and eventually run for political office myself."
0xB7D47268=今日，辩护律师Tom Goldberg于其高安保标准的Algonquin事务所遇害。据悉，Goldberg先生曾对LCPD高官和几名市政厅官员发起腐败指控。Goldberg先生此前经办过针对黑手党的诉讼、针对食品公司的集体诉讼，他还以未在火柴包装上写明「正确使用本品会产生火焰」为由起诉Strike Lite火柴公司，并且赢下了这场诉讼。其最傲慢的时刻当属控告上帝在其游行庆祝时下雨。犯人侵入了Goldberg等人共同经营的Goldberg、Ligner和Shyster律师行。律师行的合伙人Dick Shyster在新闻通稿中称赞了Goldberg先生：「在Tom帮助下得到减刑或无罪判决的委托人将会沉痛悼念他。之后我会接手他留下的大部分案子，因此我也很有希望获得他那样优秀的媒体形象，之后还能自己参选政治职位。」

;0xFBB861FF=The Police Commissioner has stated that, besides terrorists and peaceful political protest we don't approve of, the next biggest threat to civic order within Liberty City is motorcycle gangs.
