;0x7D43FB62=Today the Liberty Tree witnessed an emotional reunion between an Algonquin couple and their son who was lost for six years in a KRAPEA store.

The child's mother told reporters, "It's a miracle. We were sure that our son was dead and had even converted his bedroom into a home gym. He appears to be a little institutionalized and cannot understand why we don't have fifteen adjacent kitchens but it's great to have him back."
