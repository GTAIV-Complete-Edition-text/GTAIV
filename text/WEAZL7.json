The BAWSAQ has been in freefall the last few days, and it's the kind of news that makes terrorists rejoice and liberals wonder how they can interfere to bring prices down further. It's a natural consequence of years of over-regulation, big government and the killing of the entrepreneurial spirit that made this country the envy of foreigners everywhere. The country will enter a serious recession and be governed by a combination of Islamic terrorists, homosexuals and communists unless action is taken immediately - the government must cut the highest rate of income tax for the rich, abolish capital gains tax and liberate the rich to make investments wherever they see fit.",
            "translated": "又是我们敌人喜欢的新闻：自由的可怖代价——股市跳水。BAWSAQ股指近日几乎是自由落体，这种新闻能让恐怖分子狂喜，还会让自由派思考如何继续拉低股价。这是多年过度管制、政府干涉和企业家精神消散带来的必然后果，我国让外国人羡慕的正是企业家精神。如不立刻采取行动，我国将会陷入大萧条，还会被一群伊斯兰恐怖分子、同性恋和共产主义者统治。现在政府必须降低富人的个人所得税，废除资本利得税，并且允许富人进行任何可以获利的投资行为。",

Family values will be mandatory under the new law, and sodomy has been outlawed completely except in rare cases. Citizens are required to submit their email passwords to their local police to assist in tracking down those who would do harm to our country. Since the liberals desperately want the terrorists to win, this is a goose step in the right direction.",
            "translated": "鉴于恐怖分子想要破坏我们的生活和Rusty Brown甜品店，国会今天迈出了极具魄力的一步——通过沙文主义法案，这将给我们迷途的国家带回些许亟需的理智。新法施行后，构建家庭观念将成法定义务，肛交成为违法行为(特殊情况除外)。公民需要将自己的邮箱密码交给当地警方，以协助追查可能危害国家安全的人。既然自由派这么希望恐怖分子获胜，本法案必定是向正确方向迈出的一大步。",
