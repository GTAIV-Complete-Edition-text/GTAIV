;0x7BD708F0=Liberty City's Police Commissioner for Public Affairs, Tom Pireni, responded yesterday to the recent explosion in violent crime by laying the blame squarely at the feet of those who try to stop the police from doing their job better: the general public. He commented that, "The police don't get the respect they deserve and, quite frankly, never have. We do a very dangerous job, and have a lot of quotas to fill. To blame police priorities for rising crime is patently absurd. When arresting jay walkers or protecting film sets around the city, our officers are more than willing to get involved in any violent incidents that occur. The fact is that stopping violent crime does not put any money into this city's coffers, whereas annoying motorists is very lucrative and ensures our pensions remain intact."
0x7BD708F0=LCPD公共事务处处长Tom Pireni昨日对最近陡增的暴力犯罪率做出回应，将责任直接推到了那些试图阻止警察更好地工作的人身上：普罗大众。他说：「警方并未得到应有的尊重，说句实话，从来没有。我们的工作十分危险，而且还要达成很多指标。将犯罪率上升归咎于警察不作为十分荒谬。比起逮捕闯红灯的人和保护电影布景，我们的执法人员更愿意处理暴力犯罪案件。但实际上，阻止暴力犯罪并不会给城市财政带来任何收入，而那些危险驾驶人却往往能带来收益，还能确保我们的养老金不被削减。」

That's the way to protect our families and family values." The BAWSAQ has been dropping as concerns about the terror scare affect markets around the world. "These terrorists want to take away our freedoms. But look, we've done it for them." said Dawkins.
