[LIBTR7]
;0x1F74373F=The market has been chaotic recently. One day it's up, the next it's down. Now it's stabilized - it's started going steadily down. This makes it easier for people drawing graphs, if not for investors. It's been carnage on the market these past few days, but despite that, no one is dead. It's a metaphorical miracle, which is great for everyone apart from people who like watching snuff movies. But I digress - the economy is in free fall. People are out of jobs, and house prices are falling again. Worse, lots of rich people will see bonuses cut, but they are unlikely to have to forego that much.
0x1F74373F=近期股市震荡严重，涨一天，跌一天。但情况终于稳定了，股市稳步下跌。画走势图的人倒是省了不少麻烦，只要他画的图不是给股东看的。过去的几天是一场对股市的屠杀，不过并未出现死者，堪称奇迹，唯独对杀人实况片的爱好者是个坏消息。扯远了，经济正在自由落体，人们都在失业，房价不断下跌。更糟的是，许多富人会发现自己得到的分红减少，但这对他们似乎影响不大。

;0x224A9A04=Some, however, are skeptical about their real significance. An anonymous source said, "The Alderney mob is grabbing all the headlines at the moment for one reason - the Commission wants them to be. They got put under the heat by people snitching and all this RICO bullshit. Now they're letting these guidos from over the West River get a name for themselves so the Feds'll start investigating them instead. Simple as that. There ain't no chance of these chumps getting any real power." Whatever the case may be, organized crime is here to stay in Liberty City.
0x224A9A04=当然，也有人对五大家族的真示意图表示怀疑。匿名消息人士指出，「Alderney黑帮一时备受媒体关注只有一个原因：委员会刻意为之。告密者和RICO(组织犯罪取缔法)的存在一直让五大家族处在压力之下，现在让西河彼岸的意大利佬名声大噪，警方就会将调查重心转移。就是这样。这群白痴是不可能掌握实权的。」不论情况如何，有组织犯罪都会在自由城长期存在。

;0x25B5A0DA=However, the recent wave of state investigations into organized crime has weakened the hold of the Commission, opening up the way for a more ruthless, cutthroat approach to criminality. Gone are the days of the noble gangster leaving a tip in the pocket of truck drivers they knock over. Instead, the Alderney mob is leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake.
0x25B5A0DA=然而，近期州政府对有组织犯罪展开的调查行动削弱了委员会的控制力，让更加凶恶残忍的犯罪行为有了可乘之机。黑道打晕卡车司机后往兜里塞钱补偿的往昔岁月已然消逝。现在，Alderney黑帮只会留下尸山血海。

;0x2D99D38A=In a crazy week for stocks, prices went up, then came crashing down creating market instability and the chance for a lot of pundits to talk in a wide range of superlatives while pretending to understand what was going on. One pundit said, "It's carnage. It's like war out there. We've seen abstracts fall and futures hold steady. The bull is running, while the bear is taking it up the can." He declined to be named for this article.
0x2D99D38A=过去一周的股市十分疯狂，股价先是上涨，随后暴跌，导致股市震荡，为许多所谓的专家提供了解读行情的机会。专家指出：「这是屠杀，就像一场战争。我们早已见证过崩溃论盛行而现实安然无恙的场景。公牛正在狂奔，但狗熊依然紧追不舍。」该专家拒绝本文出现他的姓名。

;0x65F90E6C=In what many say will restore faith and pride in our country, the Jingoism Act was passed over objections of constitutional historians and rights groups. The Act requires anyone observing un-American behavior to contact authorities immediately. This includes witnessing or taking part in sexual activities not relegated to the missionary position, use of the F word, exposing a minor to adult conversation, exposure of the female breast (even for the purpose of breast feeding) and gives access to your medical records, tax records, library borrowing, if you shave downstairs, how many times you have taken the country's name in vain, and slurs against the president.
0x65F90E6C=沙文主义法案无视了历史学家与人权组织的反对，正式通过了，许多人说这会让我们的国家恢复信心与自豪。该法案要求，任何人看到有人在做「非美国行为」时，应立刻向有关部门汇报。「非美国行为」包括目击或参与不属于传教士体位的性活动，使用「++」字，在未成年人面前谈论成人话题，女性暴露乳房(为了哺乳也不行)。法案还授权政府查阅你的医疗记录、缴税记录和借书记录，记录你是否剃阴毛、亵渎本国国名几次和骂了总统几回。

;0x7BEB4D40=With a series of robberies, allegations of extortion and several racketeering cases brought against them by the Alderney state government, the so-called Alderney mob is gaining more and more prominence and column inches. Allegedly run by businessman, Jimmy Pegorino, this crime family is a new phenomenon. Previously, Alderney rackets were held by the five Liberty City families: the Ancelottis, the Pavanos, the Gambettis, the Messinas, and the Lupisellas who together formed the Commission that for many years ran crime in this town.
0x7BEB4D40=涉黑、抢劫、敲诈勒索，伴随着Alderney州政府提出的一系列指控，所谓的Alderney黑帮最近备受关注，频频登上新闻报道。这一新兴犯罪家族据说系由企业家Jimmy Pegorino营运。此前，Alderney是自由城五大家族的势力范围。由Ancelotti家族、Pavano家族、Gambetti家族、Messina家族与Lupisella家族构成的「委员会」多年来一直在本市经营犯罪事业。
