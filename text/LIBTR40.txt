;0x9EE63A6A=The serial killer who has been beheading joggers and other people foolish enough to go out late at night on their own has struck again. This time, it's the same old story. A young victim found in a sports bag. No head. And cops left rubbing theirs, as they wonder what to call him. Detective Jon Atkinson, who has been on the case since the beginning, made the following statement: "It's a great tragedy. People are focusing on the wrong things. Until the general public starts to focus on what matters, we don't have a chance of catching this guy. People are going to have to tell me: do they want the movie to be serious, or have a comic twist? Should I have a love interest? What about my partner? Will he be older and wiser, but close to retirement, a man who dies in the penultimate scene? Or a young punk, who needs a wisecracking older guy to show him the ropes? I'm really struggling with my first draft of this screenplay, and people are just going to have to be patient."
0x9EE63A6A=那个慢跑者和其他人愚蠢到深夜独自出门，现在又出事了，那个连环杀手把他们的头砍掉了。这次是老调重弹了。在一个运动包中发现的年轻受害者。没有头。警方留下擦他们的手，因为他们不知道该叫他什么。从一开始就在调查此案的Jon Atkinson侦探作了如下陈述：「这是一场巨大的灾难。人们把注意力集中在错误的事件上。在公众开始关注重要的事情之前，我们没有机会抓住这个家伙。人们不得不告诉我：他们是想让这部电影严肃点，还是想让它有一个喜剧的转折？我应该有个兴趣爱好？那我的搭档呢？他会不会变得更老、更机制，但即将退隐，一个死在倒数第二幕的人？或者一个叛逆的年轻人，需要一个爱说俏皮话的老人给他指路？我对我的第一稿剧本感到很吃力，人们只是需要耐心。」

;0xCB7669FA=Kerry McIntosh was barely 12 steps out of rehab last night when she was arrested for DUI and possession of a controlled substance, believed to be a small amount of cocaine. Once the police were made aware of Kerry's celebrity status, she signed some autographs and was released with a warning. According to a statement issued by her agent, McIntosh has decided to sue the rehab center in Los Santos, claiming that she is just as messed up as when she arrived four days earlier. Lenny Tinderman, who runs the $60,000-a-night treatment center and is an active alcoholic himself, told reporters, "Miss McIntosh checked out two hours early, against all our advice. If she cannot complete the program, we cannot take responsibility for the repercussions." In a posting on the supermodel's blog, Kerry told fans that she is now on her way to a new rest facility in the Bahamas, "An enema and a game of tennis and I'll be back on track. If I'm going to face my demons, I want to do it with an ocean view."
0xCB7669FA=Kerry McIntosh昨晚因酒后驾车和持有一种被认为是少量可卡因的违禁品而被捕，当警方得知Kerry的名人身份后，她签了一些亲笔签名，并被释放并发出警告。根据她的经纪人发表的声明，McIntosh决定起诉洛圣都的康复中心，声称她和四天前到达的时候一样一团糟。Lenny Tinderman经营着一个每晚6万美元的治疗中心，他本人也是一个敏捷的酒鬼。她对记者说：「McIntosh小姐提前两个小时退房，反对了我们的建议。如果她无法完成该计划表，我们就不能对这一影响承担责任。」在这位超级名模的博客上，Kerry告诉粉丝，她现在正在去Bahamas的一个新的休息医疗保健设施，「一次灌肠和一场网球比赛，我就会改过自新。如果我要面对我的心魔，我想通过看海景使自己平静。」
