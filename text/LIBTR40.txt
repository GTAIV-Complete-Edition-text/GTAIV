;0x9EE63A6A=The serial killer who has been beheading joggers and other people foolish enough to go out late at night on their own has struck again. This time, it's the same old story. A young victim found in a sports bag. No head. And cops left rubbing theirs, as they wonder what to call him. Detective Jon Atkinson, who has been on the case since the beginning, made the following statement: "It's a great tragedy. People are focusing on the wrong things. Until the general public starts to focus on what matters, we don't have a chance of catching this guy. People are going to have to tell me: do they want the movie to be serious, or have a comic twist? Should I have a love interest? What about my partner? Will he be older and wiser, but close to retirement, a man who dies in the penultimate scene? Or a young punk, who needs a wisecracking older guy to show him the ropes? I'm really struggling with my first draft of this screenplay, and people are just going to have to be patient."
0x9EE63A6A=一直斩首慢跑者和其他深夜独行白痴的连环杀手再次袭击，这次犯罪和他的往次犯罪没有差别。警方在旅行袋中发现了一具年轻人的尸体，没有头部。对于如何称呼这名连环杀手，警方依然摸不着头脑。对此，一直负责本案的Jon Atkinson警探表示：「这实在是悲剧。人们一直不能找到正确的关注点，在他们找到正确的关注点前，我们是不可能抓住凶手的。必须让人们告诉我：『电影要拍得严肃点，还是搞笑点？需要给我安排爱人吗？我的同伴该怎么设计？是一个年迈睿智即将退休，但会死在倒数第二幕的老头子；还是一个需要老顽童传授经验的小伙子？』我最近在绞尽脑汁地考虑剧本初稿，人们还需要耐心等待。」

;0xCB7669FA=Kerry McIntosh was barely 12 steps out of rehab last night when she was arrested for DUI and possession of a controlled substance, believed to be a small amount of cocaine. Once the police were made aware of Kerry's celebrity status, she signed some autographs and was released with a warning. According to a statement issued by her agent, McIntosh has decided to sue the rehab center in Los Santos, claiming that she is just as messed up as when she arrived four days earlier. Lenny Tinderman, who runs the $60,000-a-night treatment center and is an active alcoholic himself, told reporters, "Miss McIntosh checked out two hours early, against all our advice. If she cannot complete the program, we cannot take responsibility for the repercussions." In a posting on the supermodel's blog, Kerry told fans that she is now on her way to a new rest facility in the Bahamas, "An enema and a game of tennis and I'll be back on track. If I'm going to face my demons, I want to do it with an ocean view."
0xCB7669FA=昨晚，Kerry McIntosh还没走出戒毒所12步，就因毒驾和持有管制物品被警方逮捕。据悉，其持有的管制物品为少量可卡因。得知Kerry的名人身份后，警方让她签了几个名，并对其警告了一番，随后释放了她。根据其经纪人发表的声明，McIntosh已决定起诉洛圣都的一家戒毒中心，因为她的状态与4天前进入戒毒中心时一样糟糕。经营这家六万一晚的戒毒中心的Lenny Tinderman本人也是个酒鬼，他告诉记者：「McIntosh小姐不顾我们的劝阻，提前两小时结帐离开了我们中心。由于她没有完全完成戒毒疗程，我们不会对事后的复吸进行负责。」在这位超模的一篇博客中，她告诉粉丝说她即将前往巴哈马，去一家当地新开的设施进行疗养，「灌个肠，打局网球，我就能回到正轨了。如果我要面对心魔，我想在能看到海景的地方面对它。」
