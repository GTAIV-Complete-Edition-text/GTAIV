In light of the recent report by the National Library Center that the net generation does not read books or newspapers unless they are online, the publishers of the Liberty Tree are planning to cease the newsprint version of the paper by 2010. Readers will still be able to read their news stories online via wireless mobile devices and high-speed internet connections and blog and call each other names and be assholes on message boards. \"This really is the future. It's 2.0. It's interactive. Paper books and newsprint will be phased out by the end of the decade. Ebooks and web news are the future. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to a webinar,\" said associate publisher, Louis Fertinatta, on his new blog, which he started because some 22-year-old prick in marketing told him it was essential to the future, man.",
