;0x4EC78356=Committed family man and public servant, Bryce Dawkins, is the kind of man who spreads fear into our enemies and shows why this IS the greatest country the world has ever seen. Why? Because he says it how he sees it, not how some liberal drug-addled elite want him to say it. He spoke out yesterday over exactly the kind of thing that gives our enemies strength, and weakens our ability to respond when the unthinkable happens (for those who don't know and have been living under a rock these past 6 years, the unthinkable is obvious - foreigners trying to kill us before we kill them).
0x4EC78356=坚定的顾家男人兼人民公仆，Bryce Dawkins，会给我们的敌人送去恐惧，向世界展示美国何以成为全世界最伟大的国家。为什么？因为他说的都是自己的看法，而不是复读染有毒瘾的自由派精英写好的台本。昨天他明确指出是什么给了我们的敌人力量，削弱了我们应对匪夷所思状况的能力。(给消息不灵通和看不懂的读者的注释，匪夷所思的状况就是：外国人想在我们杀了他们之前杀了我们)

;0x802E6623=It's the taboo subject no one had thought of: Gays in the Fire Department. It's not a subject most people had worried about, but, according to Mr. Dawkins, the communal showers at most fire stations make men feel awkward. "Updating the showers to something where people can't openly stare longingly at each other's genitals would cost money and it's money I'd rather spend on protecting our city from terrorism," he said patriotically. And so say all of us. Thank you, Mr. Dawkins, for keeping it real.
0x802E6623=这是一个没人想过的禁忌话题：消防队有基佬。大多数人不会考虑这一问题，但据Dawkins先生所说，多数消防站采用的开放式公共浴室会让男人感到尴尬。他爱国地说：「如果要改造浴室，让使用者不能大大方方地眼馋别人的生殖器的话，改造所需的开销会很大，而我更愿意将这笔钱用于保护我们城市不受恐怖袭击。」我们深表同感。谢谢你，Dawkins先生，谢谢你能保持真诚。
