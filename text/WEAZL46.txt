;0x2BAB1D53=Now, he's also come out as a homosexual, married with children. Well, it's scarcely surprising. He's a liberal. Wooly thinking is their watchword. Or watch words. This news organization can never be accused of wooly thinking (apart from our weird attitude to China, but let's ignore that), so we will continue to attack liberals like him, until we have driven them out of this country for good.
0x2BAB1D53=如今，他又出柜成为一名同性恋者，而且与一名幼童结了婚。好吧，这其实一点儿也不意外。他是一个自由派。柔性思考是他们的口号。但也仅仅是口号而已。本新闻社永远不会因柔性思考被指控(除开我们对中国的古怪态度，但咱们先不管这个)，因此我们将会不停攻击像他那样的自由派，直到把他们永远逐出国门。

;0x38A0373D=Why do we think this? Mr. Dawkins admitted he took pity on Mr. Crane and gave him somewhere to stay. If this isn't an awful example of people expecting state handouts, I don't know what is. Quite frankly, I think we'd all prefer it if Mr. Crane was Mr. Dawkins' lover. It is an awful example to set. Pity is for the weak.
0x38A0373D=我们为什么要这样认为？Dawkins先生已承认自己对Crane先生的怜悯并为其提供住所。要说这不是一个人们指望政府救济的无聊实例，我都不知道还能是什么。不过老实说，如果Crane先生是Dawkins先生的情人的话，那我们还是喜闻乐见的。这是一个糟糕的榜样。因为怜悯是给弱者的。

;0x5C64FEC6=Disgraced sinner, Bryce Dawkins, was hiding a terrible secret. He lived a double life. In public, he was a staunch hang 'em and flog 'em conservative, but in private, he was a filthy liberal. The fact is Mr. Dawkins was not as conservative as he made out. He even owned a passport. Most terrorists own passports, as do many drug dealers.
0x5C64FEC6=Bryce Dawkins这个耻辱的罪人正在隐瞒一个恐怖的机密。他过着一个双面的生活。在公众面前，他是一个坚定的保守派，整天叫嚷着「吊死他们，抽死他们」，但在私下，他完全是一个肮脏猥琐的自由派。事实上，Dawkins先生并不像他表现出来的那样保守。他甚至还持有护照。而绝大多数恐怖分子都持有护照，许多毒贩也同样如此。
