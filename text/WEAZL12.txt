;0x12526F2B="If we don't get $800 million in taxpayer money, we'll leave and take our team to Los Santos. Then you'll have no baseball. You'll be left to watching softball like the girls you are. What is Liberty City without baseball? Our fans need more luxury boxes. This stadium may be on a list of historical monuments, but it needs to come down. Player salaries are skyrocketing.
