;0x1D0B6CA8=City Councilor Doris Fung, long accused of having links with several Chinatown gangs made a statement to the press, "Those who died on the docks were the victims of this crime, not the perpetrators. We shouldn't be asking who they were working for, why they had weapons or why they were on the docks in the first place. We should be asking who killed these young men." Authorities are searching for two suspects, both white males.

;0xB16F1DF5=This time it was a young dance instructor from Broker who had his head removed, but police are struggling to see a pattern or get any traction on the case. Detective Jon Atkinson, who is covering the case, said, "To be honest, it's down to underfunding - unless the police force are given better overtime and better pensions, there is no way this guy can be caught. But I want everyone to know, I will be writing a book about this case, and anyone trying to beat me to market will be sued if they mention my name. It's a tragedy." When asked about how he would respond to the on-going naming crisis that bedevils this case, he said, "It's awful. These people have died in vain and my marketing campaign is in tatters."

;0xEAD5883D=The bodies of several men have been found at the docks in Fishmarket South. Authorities believe they may have been members of a "triad" street gang smuggling contraband into Liberty City. Last year's prosecution of several members of the Dockworker's Union led to allegations of widespread corruption amongst the stevedores. A spokesperson for the National Office of Security Enforcement stated that the docks in Liberty City are the gateway through which the majority of drugs, sex slaves and counterfeit goods come into the United States, "It is only a matter of time before a terrorist smuggles a nuclear weapon through our docks. If the unions do not clean their act up and agree to serious salary cuts and concessions, this is a very real danger."
0xEAD5883D=数具尸体在Fishmarket South的码头被发现。当局认为，他们可能是向自由城走私违禁品的「三合会」街头帮派成员。去年对码头工人工会几名成员的检举，也导致码头工人内部被普遍指控腐败。国家安全执法办公室(NOOSE)发言人表示，自由城的码头就是绝大部分毒品，性奴和山寨货进入美国的大门「恐怖分子利用我们的码头走私核武器也只是一个时间问题。如果工会仍不检点他们的行为，仍不对工人让步，继续大幅度削减工资，这将会是一个很严重的问题。」
