;0x1D0B6CA8=City Councilor Doris Fung, long accused of having links with several Chinatown gangs made a statement to the press, "Those who died on the docks were the victims of this crime, not the perpetrators. We shouldn't be asking who they were working for, why they had weapons or why they were on the docks in the first place. We should be asking who killed these young men." Authorities are searching for two suspects, both white males.
0x1D0B6CA8=市议员Doris Fung长期被控与几个唐人街帮派有联系。她向媒体发表声明称：「在码头发现的死者是案件的受害者，而不是犯罪者。我们需要关心的不是他们为谁工作，不是他们为什么持有武器，也不是他们为什么会出现在码头。我们应该关心杀害这些年轻人的凶手是谁。」当局正在搜捕两名白人男性嫌疑人。

;0xB16F1DF5=This time it was a young dance instructor from Broker who had his head removed, but police are struggling to see a pattern or get any traction on the case. Detective Jon Atkinson, who is covering the case, said, "To be honest, it's down to underfunding - unless the police force are given better overtime and better pensions, there is no way this guy can be caught. But I want everyone to know, I will be writing a book about this case, and anyone trying to beat me to market will be sued if they mention my name. It's a tragedy." When asked about how he would respond to the on-going naming crisis that bedevils this case, he said, "It's awful. These people have died in vain and my marketing campaign is in tatters."
0xB16F1DF5=这次的受害者是一位住在Broker的年轻舞蹈老师，尸体没有头部，但警方却仍在全力进行调查。负责此案的Jon Atkinson说：「说实话，都是因为资金不足。除非增加警队的加班费和养老金，否则我们不可能抓到这个罪犯。但我要在此通知一件事，我会就本案写一本书，任何想抢在我之前推出竞品的人，只要在书中提到我的名字就会被起诉。真是悲剧。」当被问及他对困扰本案的凶手命名风波有何回应时，他表示：「实在是太糟了。受害者都白白牺牲了，我的市场竞争也将无从谈起。」

;0xEAD5883D=The bodies of several men have been found at the docks in Fishmarket South. Authorities believe they may have been members of a "triad" street gang smuggling contraband into Liberty City. Last year's prosecution of several members of the Dockworker's Union led to allegations of widespread corruption amongst the stevedores. A spokesperson for the National Office of Security Enforcement stated that the docks in Liberty City are the gateway through which the majority of drugs, sex slaves and counterfeit goods come into the United States, "It is only a matter of time before a terrorist smuggles a nuclear weapon through our docks. If the unions do not clean their act up and agree to serious salary cuts and concessions, this is a very real danger."
0xEAD5883D=数具尸体在鱼市南的码头被发现。当局认为，他们可能是向自由城走私违禁品的街头帮派「三合会」的成员。由于码头工人工会有成员于去年遭到起诉，现在人们普遍认为码头工人中存在腐败。国家安全办公室(NOOSE)发言人表示，自由城的码头是绝大部分毒品、性奴和山寨货进入美国的大门。「恐怖分子利用码头走私核武器也只是时间问题。如果工会还不检点他们的行为，仍然拒绝削减工资，情况就很严重了。」
