            "original": "The serial killer our unimaginative police force and media cannot name has struck again. This time, a jogger in Alderney got the chop as a headless body was found in some bushes by the river. The body had been badly mutilated and taken advantage of, and police have still not identified the victim. Local residents are starting to panic. One local heavy-set woman, Siobhan Phillips, told us, \"They say keeping fit is good for you; well, it wasn't good for this man - he went running and had his head chopped off by a maniac.\" Of greater concern for many is the failure by our police force to name the killer. Surely a man who chops off heads for fun could inspire a funny nickname or moniker of some sort?",

In the old days, we'd make racist jokes and have a great time; now people get all excited about racial equality, and the result - anarchy on our streets.\" Whatever the cause, the failure to give this serial killer a nickname is likely to damage future movie rights and book deals. Detective Jon Atkinson asked that we mention him in this story, so we just have.",
