;0xC65F84D3=Worrying trends on the markets as the BAWSAQ refused to allow a discernible pattern to emerge. It went up and it went down and then it went nowhere. And we are not sure what to make of it; in a world in which no news is definitely bad news, especially for our ability to make money off this website. The fact is we'd like a pattern, as that would give us a story and currently we've got neither. It's a mess, and that makes it harder for people to say anything intelligent. Like when you vomit. It's not a bull, it's not a bear. It's a puddle of bile.
0xC65F84D3=市场行情令人担忧，BAWSAQ大盘仍未给出明确走势。先是上涨，又是下跌，然后上下乱窜。我们不知道该怎么办，毕竟这个世界没有绝对的坏消息，而我们经营网站的目的也是为了营利。实际上我们都希望走势明确，因为这样我们还有故事能讲，但现在我们既看不清走势，又讲不出故事。实在是混乱，混乱到任何人都难以说出明智的话，就像你呕吐的时候。这不是牛市，也不是熊市，这就是一滩胆汁。

;0xF6226460=In a world in which clever rich people can make money if the market goes down or up, the one thing we are told to write that we hate is the market doing nothing consistently. So come on Feds, loosen up regulations, stop trying to tell us what to do and allow unbridled capitalism to let the power brokers gain greater control for all our good.
0xF6226460=身在这个聪明的富人无论行情好坏都能赚钱的世界中，我们很讨厌写上面布置的这种稿子：市场依然无所作为。快点啊，联邦政府，放松管制，别再教我们做事了，快让资本主义脱缰，让有权有势的人拥有更大的权力，这样对大家都好。
