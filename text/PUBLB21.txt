;0xA57FB46E=With the murder of heroic attorney, Tom Goldberg, a blow has been struck to the heart of the first amendment and freedom fighters everywhere. A moment of silence was called in the blogosphere as Mr. Goldberg stood for the freedom of speech and the rights of the little man to slander people anonymously online with no repercussions. He was in favor of immigration and proposed much tighter gun control. No wonder so few conservatives are mourning. He stood up to corporate America and the links between big business and government.
0xA57FB46E=在英勇的律师Tom Goldberg被谋杀后，《第一修正案》和各地自由斗士的内心都受到了沉重打击。博客圈响起一阵默哀，Goldberg先生支持言论自由，为普通人在网上匿名诽谤他人而没有后果站台。他支持移民，并提议加强枪支管制。难怪如此少的保守派人士在哀悼。他坚决反对美国公司和政商勾结。
