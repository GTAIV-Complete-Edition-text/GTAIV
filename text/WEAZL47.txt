;0x42908204=Despite Wolfe's baseless allegations, the 'Roman Empire Wealth System' has been an upstanding sponsor of Weazel News and we cannot allow some cretin to sully its name. Life is full of risks and, as civilization goes down the toilet, it only means more ratings and sponsors for us.
0x42908204=尽管Wolfe的指控毫无根据，「罗马帝国财富系统」一直是Weazel新闻的强力赞助商，而我们绝不容许某些白痴玷污它的清誉。生活充满风险，而且随着文明的衰落，我们的收视率只会更高，赞助商也会更多。

;0xA80F42FD=It seems that nobody is immune to the temptations of 'get rich quick' schemes on the Internet. Brilliant economist and Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Darius Wolfe, has revealed that he was persuaded into investing $20,000 into a online pyramid scheme. "As soon as I received the spam email titled 'Amazing Business Opportunity' that directed me to <a href="www.money2makemoney.com">www.money2makemoney.com</a>, I just had to know more," said Wolfe, "I've never been able to resist a risky investment."

;0xC7812B97=We at Weazel News say fair enough. In England they call each other the C word all the time. Here it is somehow held in high esteem as the argument ender - the word that is at the point of no return and makes her leave you for good. No word on if the Lip Reading Bee will continue.
0xC7812B97=我们Weazel新闻已经很客观了。在英格兰，他们一直都互称对方为「〇逼」。在美国则被视作争论的终结者——此言一出，即无回旋余地，她就会离你而去。读唇大赛是否会继续举办目前尚无定数。

;0xDBDCD44E=We've all covertly mouthed something to someone, such as "Let's get out of here," or "I'm going to kill you," or "Hurry, before my husband gets back." But lip reading isn't just important for communicating quests for infidelity. It is a fundamental part of the academic process, and this year it was being celebrated at the inaugural Lip Reading Bee.
0xDBDCD44E=我们都悄悄地用口型跟别人说过话，比如「我们赶紧跑吧」「我要杀了你」或者「快点，我老公要回来了」。但是读唇不仅对偷情时的交流重要，在学术研究中也十分重要，今年的读唇大赛也备受人们关注。
