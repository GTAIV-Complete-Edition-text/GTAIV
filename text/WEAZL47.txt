;0x42908204=Despite Wolfe's baseless allegations, the 'Roman Empire Wealth System' has been an upstanding sponsor of Weazel News and we cannot allow some cretin to sully its name. Life is full of risks and, as civilization goes down the toilet, it only means more ratings and sponsors for us.
0x42908204=别在乎Wolfe那毫无根据的指控，「Roman Empire Wealth System」现已成为Weazel News的光明正大的赞助商，而我们绝不能容许某些白痴病患者玷污它的清誉。就像上厕所一样，生活也是充满风险，并且那对我们来说紧紧意味着更高的收视率和更多的赞助商。

;0xA80F42FD=It seems that nobody is immune to the temptations of 'get rich quick' schemes on the Internet. Brilliant economist and Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Darius Wolfe, has revealed that he was persuaded into investing $20,000 into a online pyramid scheme. "As soon as I received the spam email titled 'Amazing Business Opportunity' that directed me to <a href="www.money2makemoney.com">www.money2makemoney.com</a>, I just had to know more," said Wolfe, "I've never been able to resist a risky investment."

;0xC7812B97=We at Weazel News say fair enough. In England they call each other the C word all the time. Here it is somehow held in high esteem as the argument ender - the word that is at the point of no return and makes her leave you for good. No word on if the Lip Reading Bee will continue.
0xC7812B97=Weazel News的我们说的很有道理了。在英格兰，他们一直都互称对方【the C word】。在这里它在某种程度上作为高度正式场合中辩论的结束——此言一出，即无回旋余地，并且你们永不再就此辩论。而如果Lip Reading Bee继续运行，则不再有必要说话了。

;0xDBDCD44E=We've all covertly mouthed something to someone, such as "Let's get out of here," or "I'm going to kill you," or "Hurry, before my husband gets back." But lip reading isn't just important for communicating quests for infidelity. It is a fundamental part of the academic process, and this year it was being celebrated at the inaugural Lip Reading Bee.
0xDBDCD44E=我们都曾秘密地跟某人说过某事，例如「让我们离开这里」或者「我要宰了你」又或者「动作快点，别等我老公回来。」但是唇读对不忠行为的交流需求来说，就不仅仅是重要了。它是学术研究中的一个基础部分，而且今年它将为Lip Reading Bee的开创性发行而庆祝。
