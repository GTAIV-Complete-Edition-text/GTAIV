Obviously, video games also cause global warming and a lot of antisocial behavior, including farting, but now it turns out they also cause impotence in 90% of men, according to reports published yesterday. It makes a lot of sense - for years people put the falling birth rate down to the hopelessness of contemporary society and the terror of living in a godless world, but thankfully we have a new enemy.",
