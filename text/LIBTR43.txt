;0x03D27E96=The music was powerful, the conversations were earnest and the sex was mind-blowing. It seemed like the party was never going to end. Then it did. You got a bit fat around the middle. You began having serious conversations about mortgages. Ravers and party goers emerged from the best decade of their lives only to be hit with the grim reality that they were going to pay the price for all that fun. Ten years later, people are starting to worry when all the devastating long-term effects are going to kick in. The answer is any minute. "Every time I get a cold or forget my keys, I am convinced that it's the beginning of the end; that I'm going to be found rocking in darkened room in a state of permanent catatonia from all that LSD, Ecstasy and weed I did," said James, a 33-year-old lawyer from Algonquin, "If it doesn't happen soon, I'm going to dust off the white gloves and glow sticks and get back out there."
0x03D27E96=音乐很有效，他的谈话很认真，性爱让人心惊肉跳。好像政党从来没有结束过。就这样做了。你中间有点胖。你开始认真地谈论抵押贷款。狂欢节和参加派对的人走出了他们生命中最美好的十年，却被残酷的现实所打击，他们要为所有的乐趣付出代价。十年后，人们开始担心当所有破坏性的长期效应都要开始时。答案是任何时候。「每次我感冒或忘记钥匙，我都相信这是结束的开始；我会在黑暗的房间里摇动并被发现，因为我做了所有的迷幻剂、迷魂药和大麻，使我处于永久的兴奋状态。」James说道，一名33岁的来自Algonquin的律师，「如果不尽快发生，我会擦去白色的手套和荧光棒的灰尘，然后回到那里。」

;0x4E0AF489=The tragic death of Charles Pathmanson became even more tragic as investigators say a tragic tale of tragedy is unfolding in the tragic emails sent to Pathmanson days before his tragic tragedy. Known to have built the "Kitchen of the Future", Pathmanson had been battling hackers who had broken into his appliances and began turning them on and off, setting his oven at 500 degrees in the middle of the night, fatally breaking the ice machine, and continually making the toaster pop up and down. In an act of desperation, Pathmanson attempted to install a firewall and new motherboard in the toaster, at which point hackers switched it on and electrocuted him. Police are trolling online games and "asking these snotfaced little egomaniacal griefers if they know anything about it," Police investigator Mike Loretti said in a statement.
0x4E0AF489=Charles Pathmanson的悲惨死亡变得更加悲惨，因为调查人员说，在他的悲剧发生前几天，他收到了一封悲惨的电子邮件，其中讲述了一个悲剧的故事。Pathmanson制造了「未来的厨房」，一直在与黑客作战，他们黑入了他的电器，并开始打开和关闭，在半夜把他的烤箱设置在500度，不可避免地破坏了制冰机，并不停地让烤面包机反复弹出。在一次铤而走险的行为中，Pathmanson试图在烤面包机上安装防火墙和新主板，这时，黑客们把它打开电死了他。警方调查人员Mike Loretti在一份声明中说：「警方正在调查网络赌博，并询问这些势利的自大狂是否知道这件事。」

;0xD72F8D98=In a horrifying turn of events, a man has been murdered at his own wedding in Suffolk. The groom, Roman Bellic, 31, was a business-owner currently living in Middle Park East. His bride, Mallorie Bellic, was unavailable for a statement. Witnesses report that a man approached the wedding party outside the church, shot Mr. Bellic, and then turned the gun on himself. Mr. Bellic's cousin, Niko, was reported to have left the scene soon after the murder. He is being sought for questioning in the case but not as a suspect. Speculation is rife as to the motive of this crime. The killer may have been a jilted lover, a terrorist, a man driven mad by violent video games or the member of a sick death cult.
0xD72F8D98=在一个可怕的事件中，一个人在Suffolk的婚礼上被谋杀了。新郎，Roman　Bellic，31岁，是目前居住在Middle Park East的一个企业主。他的新娘Mallorie　Bellic在声明中不可用。目击者报告说，一个男人接近教堂外的婚礼聚会，枪杀了Bellic先生，然后把枪对准自己。据报道，Bellic的堂弟Niko在谋杀后不久就离开了现场。他正被要求在案件中提问，但并不作为嫌疑人。对于这种犯罪的动机，投机是普遍的。凶手可能是一个被抛弃的情人，一个恐怖分子，一个被暴力的电子游戏逼疯的人，或是一个病态的死亡邪教的成员。
