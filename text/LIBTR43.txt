;0x03D27E96=The music was powerful, the conversations were earnest and the sex was mind-blowing. It seemed like the party was never going to end. Then it did. You got a bit fat around the middle. You began having serious conversations about mortgages. Ravers and party goers emerged from the best decade of their lives only to be hit with the grim reality that they were going to pay the price for all that fun. Ten years later, people are starting to worry when all the devastating long-term effects are going to kick in. The answer is any minute. "Every time I get a cold or forget my keys, I am convinced that it's the beginning of the end; that I'm going to be found rocking in darkened room in a state of permanent catatonia from all that LSD, Ecstasy and weed I did," said James, a 33-year-old lawyer from Algonquin, "If it doesn't happen soon, I'm going to dust off the white gloves and glow sticks and get back out there."
0x03D27E96=音乐很动感，对话很真诚，性爱让人陷入幻想风暴。这场派对似乎永远都不会结束。然后它结束了。你的腹部长出赘肉，你开始思考如何贷款。社交狂和派对狂走出了生命中最美好的十年，然后沉重的现实给了他们当头一棒——他们要为曾经的狂欢付出代价了。十年之后，他们开始担心那些毁灭性的副作用何时显现了。而答案是随时都会显现。来自Algonquin的33岁的James说：「每次我得了感冒或者忘带钥匙的时候，我就觉得自己的末日要来了，我要为自己以前吸食的LSD、摇头丸和大麻付出代价了，我马上就会在小黑屋里满地打滚，患上永久的紧张症了。不过要是还有很久才会付出代价，我大概会戴上白手套、拿出荧光棒回到那里吧。」

;0x4E0AF489=The tragic death of Charles Pathmanson became even more tragic as investigators say a tragic tale of tragedy is unfolding in the tragic emails sent to Pathmanson days before his tragic tragedy. Known to have built the "Kitchen of the Future", Pathmanson had been battling hackers who had broken into his appliances and began turning them on and off, setting his oven at 500 degrees in the middle of the night, fatally breaking the ice machine, and continually making the toaster pop up and down. In an act of desperation, Pathmanson attempted to install a firewall and new motherboard in the toaster, at which point hackers switched it on and electrocuted him. Police are trolling online games and "asking these snotfaced little egomaniacal griefers if they know anything about it," Police investigator Mike Loretti said in a statement.
0x4E0AF489=Charles Pathmanson的悲惨死亡比想象中还要悲惨。调查人员表示，在他的悲惨惨剧发生的前一天，悲剧的他收到了一封悲剧的邮件，邮件中写着一个悲剧的悲惨故事。Pathmanson是「未来厨房」项目的设计师，他的电器长期被黑客入侵、开开关关，烤炉在半夜被设置到500度，制冰机被黑客远程破坏，面包机中的面包也被反复弹出。而他也一直在与黑客对抗。当时Pathmanson正在给面包机安装防火墙、替换主板，这时黑客启动了面包机，致其触电身亡。目前警方正在网络游戏中进行调查，据警探Mike Loretti所说，他们同时也在「询问那些自私自利的自大狂是否知晓相关情况」。

;0xD72F8D98=In a horrifying turn of events, a man has been murdered at his own wedding in Suffolk. The groom, Roman Bellic, 31, was a business-owner currently living in Middle Park East. His bride, Mallorie Bellic, was unavailable for a statement. Witnesses report that a man approached the wedding party outside the church, shot Mr. Bellic, and then turned the gun on himself. Mr. Bellic's cousin, Niko, was reported to have left the scene soon after the murder. He is being sought for questioning in the case but not as a suspect. Speculation is rife as to the motive of this crime. The killer may have been a jilted lover, a terrorist, a man driven mad by violent video games or the member of a sick death cult.
