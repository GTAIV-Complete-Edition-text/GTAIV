;0x54F9D6B8=Police officers spoke out yesterday about the incredible spate of urban myths that are damaging the image of Liberty City. The nonstop rumors of dead pop stars, sasquatches, giant alligators, secret cities, invincible criminals, and dogs have all been causing wide spread disturbances "in the minds of insane residents", said one spokesman, who was investigating reports a man had his drink spiked and a kidney stolen, which turned out to be spurious. We will stay with this story. In related news, police are investigating claims a whale was seen swimming in Middle Park.

;0x868CF4CF=An audacious prison escape, like something you might see on a Weazel Network show, occurred ninety seven feet under the surface of the West River earlier. A convoy carrying convicted felon, Aiden O'Malley, was ambushed by two trucks. O'Malley was being taken from a police station in Algonquin back to the Alderney State Correctional Facility. Two men used the trucks to block the convoy from the front and the back in the middle of the Booth Tunnel while they freed O'Malley. O'Malley, 48, who is American born but spent much of his adult life in Ireland, was serving a twenty-year term for his involvement in a string of robberies.
0x868CF4CF=不久前在西河之下97英尺的地方，发生了一起惊天劫狱案，就像Weazel电视台的节目演的那样。押运重罪犯Aiden O'Malley的囚车车队正在将O'Malley由Algonquin警局押送至Alderney州监狱，途中遭到了两辆卡车截击。车队驶至Booth隧道中段时，两名男子驾驶卡车一前一后拦截了车队，随后劫走了O'Malley。现年48岁的O'Malley出生于美国，但他的成年生活大部分在爱尔兰度过，他因参加了一系列的抢劫活动被判20年有期徒刑。

;0xAE86C4C2=O'Malley was returning from a deposition in which he gave evidence implicating his accomplices in the carrying-out of those robberies. Police were particularly interested in his testimony relating to Bucky Sligo, who recently died. Now authorities are concerned that all of his testimony may have been used somehow to facilitate his escape. Police warn that O'Malley and his cohorts are armed and considered very dangerous.
