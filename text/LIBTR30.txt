;0x54F9D6B8=Police officers spoke out yesterday about the incredible spate of urban myths that are damaging the image of Liberty City. The nonstop rumors of dead pop stars, sasquatches, giant alligators, secret cities, invincible criminals, and dogs have all been causing wide spread disturbances "in the minds of insane residents", said one spokesman, who was investigating reports a man had his drink spiked and a kidney stolen, which turned out to be spurious. We will stay with this story. In related news, police are investigating claims a whale was seen swimming in Middle Park.
0x54F9D6B8=昨日警方发表讲话，主题是正在破坏自由城形象的各种离奇都市传说。对于已逝流行明星、长毛野人、巨鳄、神秘都市、不败罪犯还有各种狗在内的引起广泛骚乱的都市传说，一位警官称它们为「疯子公民所臆想的」。在这位警官调查报告中，一名男子被发现饮酒过量，肾脏被偷，而最终结果指出一切都是伪造的。我们将对此保持持续关注。而有相关报道称，警方正在调查在中央公园目击鲸鱼游泳的说法。

;0x868CF4CF=An audacious prison escape, like something you might see on a Weazel Network show, occurred ninety seven feet under the surface of the West River earlier. A convoy carrying convicted felon, Aiden O'Malley, was ambushed by two trucks. O'Malley was being taken from a police station in Algonquin back to the Alderney State Correctional Facility. Two men used the trucks to block the convoy from the front and the back in the middle of the Booth Tunnel while they freed O'Malley. O'Malley, 48, who is American born but spent much of his adult life in Ireland, was serving a twenty-year term for his involvement in a string of robberies.
0x868CF4CF=就像你可能会在Weazel Network的节目中看到的那样，不久前在West River之下97英尺的地方，发生了一起惊天劫狱案。装有重罪犯Aiden O'Malley的囚车车队正在执行把O'Malley由Algonquin警局押送至Alderney州监狱的任务，途中遭到了两辆陌生卡车伏击。当囚车车队开到Booth隧道的中段时，两名男子开着卡车一前一后挡住了车队，同时在中间劫走了O'Malley。现年48岁的O'Malley出生于美国，但他的成年生活大部分在爱尔兰度过，他因参加了一系列的抢劫活动而服刑20年。

;0xAE86C4C2=O'Malley was returning from a deposition in which he gave evidence implicating his accomplices in the carrying-out of those robberies. Police were particularly interested in his testimony relating to Bucky Sligo, who recently died. Now authorities are concerned that all of his testimony may have been used somehow to facilitate his escape. Police warn that O'Malley and his cohorts are armed and considered very dangerous.
0xAE86C4C2=O'Malley的证词中供出了和他一起抢劫的同伙们。警方对他关于最近去世的Bucky Sligo的证词特别感兴趣。而现在当局担心，他所说的所有的证词可能只是为了他能逃脱。警方警告，O'Malley以及他的武装同伙们非常危险。
