;0xC0F5842D=Senator Charles Martin said, "We were in a never-ending loop with border security. You keep seeing the same faces again and again. However, we have broken that cycle. Giving greater authority to our brave men and women who are sitting in the hot desert for days straight to find a permanent solution to this problem is working. Granted, a few families driving back from a vacation in Mexico have been gunned down at border checkpoints, but security is our number one concern. There will always be some collateral damage."
