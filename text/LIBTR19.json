The victim, a Mr. Tom Rivas, had told the owner of the 69th Street Diner that he was on a \"hot date.\" He was then seen in a romantic context with an older, \"foreign-looking\" man. Moments later, he was dead. Mr. Rivas was unemployed but is reported to have had a number of older boyfriends who supported him. Police are currently pursuing all leads in the hope that one will lead them to the killer.",

We spend years putting our drugs through clinical trials and giving lab monkeys exploding erections.
