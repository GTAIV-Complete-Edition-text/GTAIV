;0x036809CF=The bridges being shut is exactly the kind of thing that showed the terrorists that their tactics were not working, because we could shut bridges and keep them out and then go and blow up their countries. Now where are we? In another fine liberal mess.
0x036809CF=大桥的关闭无疑证明了恐怖分子战术的失效，因为我们可以关闭大桥将他们拦在门外，接着去轰炸他们的国家。可我们现在处在什么境地？我们陷入了又一场精妙的自由主义混乱中。

;0x14CEAC80=So, they've opened the bridge and tunnel into Algonquin from Alderney? What a pathetic liberal copout! Allow people their freedom? We'll be free when we are all dead at this rate. The fact is terrorists use bridges to cross rivers and to kill innocent lives. Families will die because of this - we are at war, and when you're at war, you should suffer.
0x14CEAC80=所以呢，他们开放了从Alderney通向Algonquin的大桥？这真是可悲的自由派的退缩！竟然给予人民自由？照这样下去我们都会自由的，死了就可以了。事实是这些恐怖分子利用大桥穿过河道来杀死无辜的民众。家庭会因此四分五裂——我们陷入了战争，而人一旦陷入战争就会受难。
