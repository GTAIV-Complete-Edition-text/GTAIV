But the question on everyone's lips - is it ok for your clone to give you a hand job, or for you to engage in sodomy with your clone? Dr. Yahann Klietzel, a prominent reproductive scientist and geneticist says, \"This is a breakthrough in science. Finally we are able to clone ourselves, so while your clone is going to work and making the money, you are able to stay at home and masturbate and play video games, just like women. And when your clone comes home, you can enjoy each other in any way you want. Truly, this is the future.\" Klietzel added, \"Oh, yes, it is not gay.\"",
