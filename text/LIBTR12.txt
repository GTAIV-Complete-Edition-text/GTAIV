;0x2E3AE0DD=The police are demanding greater funds and expect massive public anxiety over the matter. One criminal expert, Jimmy Cast, is less convinced. The well-known expert on organized crime in our city commented, "There will always be gangs of criminals at work, especially when you have a lot of poor immigrants, but the idea that they will ever supersede the Mafia in importance is frankly laughable, as they will never be able to take control of so many government and city departments. Of course, following years of being attacked by law enforcement, the Mafia are in decline, but bear in mind it also serves them to exaggerate the extent of their decline so people leave them alone." Whichever way you look at it, crime in Liberty City remains an international business and something we do best.
0x2E3AE0DD=警方要求得到更多经费，并期望公众对犯罪激增的现状感到恐慌。但本市研究有组织犯罪的知名专家Jimmy Cast并不同意警方的观点。他说：「贫穷移民的存在必然带来犯罪组织，但认为他们会取代黑手党纯属无稽之谈，因为那些贫穷移民根本不可能控制繁多的政府机构和市政部门。的确，黑手党在多年的执法打击下呈现颓势，但夸大他们的颓势只会帮助他们淡出公众视线，让他们得以隐蔽生长。」无论你的观点如何，自由城的犯罪都会保持国际化的现状，也仍是我们这儿的特产。

;0xA5186AF6=The Swingers have announced to baseball officials that they will officially strike if the city refuses to come to the bargaining table regarding the building of a new stadium. Designs call for a radical vision of all luxury boxes and no open seats. "Sponsorships and corporate boxes are the most important thing in baseball, and currently we aren't able to serve our real fans. And by real fans I mean the ones who are able to support the team with $50,000 luxury boxes. It makes a player feel good to know that fans are comfortable in air-conditioned luxury boxes, knocking back 12 or 18 beers, shoving nachos in their faces and making passes at each other's wives," said team manager Henry Thornsteen.
0xA5186AF6=浪人队已向棒球官员宣布，若市政府拒绝就新建体育场进行谈判，他们将正式罢工。球队要求采用全豪华包厢的激进设计，亦即不设露天观众席。球队经理Henry Thornsteen说：「赞助商和企业包厢才是棒球运动中最重要的部分，而目前我们无法为真正的球迷服务。这个『真球迷』指的是能花五万美元包下豪华包厢来支持球队的人。球员会为自己的球迷能在豪华空调包厢舒服地看球感到高兴，更别提球迷们还能喝上一打半的啤酒，把玉米片糊到脸上，然后互玩换妻Play了。」

;0xB2C8E9FB=Once it was the Mafia, the Jewish mob and the fighting Irish. Now it is Albanian, Russian, Jamaican and Korean hoodlums who are as likely to be running rackets and dealing drugs. Crime in Liberty has changed as the population has changed, and the recent bloodbath in a Hove Beach nightclub has shone a light on the murky world of the underworld. The police have few links with these newer communities in our city, and language barriers often make it harder for them to find out what is going on, so crime has run riot in a way not seen since the passing of the RICO act in the 1970s.
0xB2C8E9FB=从前是黑手党，犹太黑帮和爱尔兰斗士。现在是来自阿尔巴尼亚、俄罗斯、牙买加和朝鲜的各国暴徒，他们几乎都在敲诈勒索、贩卖毒品。随着人口的变化，自由城的犯罪行为也发生了变化，最近在Hove Beach夜总会的大屠杀照亮了黑社会的现状。警方在本市的这些新帮派中几乎没有线人，而语言障碍也让警方更难了解情况。因此犯罪行为愈演愈烈，达到了上世纪70年代RICO法案(组织犯罪取缔法)通过以来前所未有的新高度。

;0xE8CEC144=A nightclub owner is dead and the beachside communities of east Broker are in panic after another violent shoot out last night. Patrons at the Russian-themed Perestroika night club and cabaret were horrified when an argument between the owner and a man he appeared to know ended in murder. The owner, Mikhail Faustin, 45, was killed along with several accomplices whose names have not yet been released by police. The assailant escaped. Eye witnesses described a dark-haired European man in his late twenties or early 30s of average height and build, which does not narrow it down that much.
0xE8CEC144=昨晚又一起暴力枪战在Broker东部发生，一名夜总会老板死亡，海滨一带的居民陷入恐慌。死者生前经营的Perestroika是一家俄罗斯风格的夜总会，其与熟人发生的争执最终成为了一起杀人案，令当时在场的顾客受到惊吓。死者是45岁的Mikhail Faustin，与他一起遇害的还有他的数名保镖，但警方尚未公开其他死者的姓名。凶手仍然在逃。据目击者描述，凶手是一名深色头发的欧洲人，年龄大约在30岁左右，不胖不瘦，不高不矮。然而这份证词很难缩小嫌疑人范围。
