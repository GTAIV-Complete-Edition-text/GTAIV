;0x10FCA667=Activists are outraged at what the blogosphere has dubbed the "Broker Bridge Massacre." Members of the media and activist groups charged into police headquarters to hear talking head Police Commissioner for Public Affairs, Tom Pireni, attempt to deflect complaints of brutality. In a slick propaganda slideshow and musical performance targeted to sooth activists, the show did nothing but enrage them. We should be able to do anything and go anywhere we want. What do we need police for?
0x10FCA667=社会活动家对博客圈称为「Broker桥大屠杀」的事件感到愤怒。媒体人员和社会活动团体冲入警局总部质问警局公共事务处处长，Tom Pireni。他本想转移对暴力执法的控诉，但这场用于安抚社会活动家的空话宣传讲座和音乐表演反而激怒了他们。我们应该能做任何事情，去任何想去的地方。我们要警察干嘛?

;0x438F0B8B=Police brutality must stop. Searches and seizures must stop, especially among epileptics. And those announcements in the subway are creepy. What year are we in? 1984? Bloggers unite. Only by complaining to each other in the cold, hollow halls of cyberspace can we stop this police brutality.
0x438F0B8B=暴力执法必须停止。搜查和罚没必须停止，尤其是不合理的搜查罚没。而且地铁站里的那些布告十分骇人。我们现在是哪一年？1984年？博主们联合起来。只有在寒冷、空洞的网络世界中相互控诉，我们才能阻止警察的暴力执法。
