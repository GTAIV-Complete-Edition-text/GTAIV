The \"Wing It\" slideshow presentation was given to the media today, arguing that the \"Broker Bridge Incident\" is not considered police brutality. After a bizarre musical performance, many residents were not convinced. Several residents have filed formal complaints after footage today showing several women and children being thrown off the bridge by police. Police argue that the footage does not tell the real story.",

Liberty City Police, N.O.O.S.E agents and Bureau of Narcotics officials did not release the names of the suspects but indicated meth is a serious problem in Liberty City. \"Meth has destroyed the lives and businesses of cocaine dealers in Vice City, and we see the same happening here,\" said agent Albert Thomas. Thomas would not indicate what made the elderly resident call in the tip but said that the woman smelled like an old person and reminded him of when his grandmother showed him her junk.",
