;0x51E8969B=Every revolution needs a name, and this one is 2.0. Web 2.0 is so amazing that what most people don't realize is that there never was a dotcom bubble. Web 2.0 is the second generation. You are probably still living in your Web 1.0 land - never even aware that everything has evolved, passed you by and left you for dead. You are old. You are becoming irrelevant. Kids look at you with disgust. You are living in an information silo while the rest of us are 26-7 Internet 2.0. When I shit, it is automatically recorded on my blog, an RSS feed is sent out, my <a href="www.grype.org">www.grype.org</a> buddies are notified, and it goes out to the <a href="www.myroomonline.net">www.myroomonline.net</a> community. It's a revolution. I have thousands of friends I've never met. I am so alone. The darkness is closing in.
0x51E8969B=革命都得有个名号，而这次的革命就叫2.0。Web 2.0如此神奇，导致绝大多数人都没有意识到从未有什么互联网泡沫。Web 2.0已是第二世代了，你却可能还活在Web 1.0的土地上——浑然不知一切都进化了，一切都抛下了你，离你而去。你已经老了，和社会脱节了。孩子们会用厌恶的眼光看你。你活在信息孤岛上，而我们其他人都26x7地活在互联网2.0中。我一拉屎，就会自动记录在博客上，然后推送一条RSS，我在 <a href="www.grype.org">www.grype.org</a> 上的好友就会收到提醒，之后再流传到 <a href="www.myroomonline.net">www.myroomonline.net</a> 社区。这是一场革命。我拥有成百上千个素未谋面的朋友。我如此寂寞。黑暗已然来临。

;0x72760F40=We are all doomed, living in a low-lying coastal city, but while the government willfully refuses to consider outlawing cars or energy, we might as well drown ourselves. Future generations will hate us even more than we hate ourselves, and the fact is they will be right.
0x72760F40=我们都要完蛋了，住在低洼的沿海城市，政府却仍然拒绝出台汽车或能源方面的禁令，我们自己都要被淹死了。我们的后代会比我们自身更加憎恨我们，而实际上他们憎恨得很对。

;0xA0C1EBD7=The bridge and tunnel crossings between Algonquin and Alderney were finally reopened yesterday as the terror threat caused by the mismanagement of the war on terror was deemed to have sufficiently reduced enough to allow us to carry on destroying the planet by the burning of fossil fuels. It's global warming stupid. It's a win - win for big business as usual. As income from the war goes down, oil revenues go up as people start increasing their carbon footprint again.
0xA0C1EBD7=鉴于由反恐战争管理不当造成的恐怖主义威胁已经降低，连接Algonquin和Alderney的大桥及隧道终于于昨日重新开放，我们又可以照常燃烧化石能源破坏地球了。全球变暖诶，白痴！这次又是政界与商界的双赢。随着由战争带来的收入减少，通过石油取得的收入又一次随着民众碳排放的提高而提高。
