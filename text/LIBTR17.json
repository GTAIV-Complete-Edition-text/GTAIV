Two buildings including a taxi garage were recently gutted by fire. Although two men were seen starting the fire with Molotov cocktails, no arrests have been made. We will stay with this story if we can find something interesting to say. In the meantime, be very suspicious of anyone buying vodka, matches and a gas soaked rag, but try not to panic. Local police were appealing for calm and also lots of snitches and widespread anxiety.",

It isn't nations fighting but rival motorcycle gangs battling for control of the streets. Men have died in this war, like The Lost biker Jason Michaels who was killed in Broker recently. How long is it going to be before innocent civilians are killed as well? Mainly thanks to the Angels of Death and their public relations efforts, biker gangs have taken on a much more friendly image in recent years. They appear in family-friendly movies and are romanticized in video games and TV shows. They are thought to stand for a noble rebellion against the norms of society. Be warned, this image is just a smokescreen used to cover up their real criminal agenda - sleeping with your wife and selling meth to your kids.",
            "translated": "一场由汽油、皮革和冰毒驱动的战争正在自由城的街道上演。这不是国与国的争斗，而是敌对摩托帮间的地盘争夺。这场战争已经出现了死者，比如失落帮的Jason Michaels就于近日在Broker遇害。再过多久才会出现无辜平民遇害呢？多亏了死亡天使的公关工作，近年来民众对摩托帮的印象十分良好。他们在合家欢电影里出镜，在电视上和游戏里美化自己，将自己塑造成反抗社会陈规的高尚叛逆者。当心点，这幅表象只是伪装犯罪企图的烟雾弹，他们的真正目的是：睡了你的老婆，毒害你的孩子。",
