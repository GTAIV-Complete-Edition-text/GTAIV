;0x1B8CA6FD=It seems that, as in every industry, these new gangs need to succeed more desperately than their American counterparts and they are willing to pay a price for success that others are not. Mayor Ochoa has to keep to his word and do something about this problem. Until then, the helpless residents of Liberty City must remain at the mercy of these foreign thugs.
0x1B8CA6FD=看起来，就像在每一个行业一样，这些新的帮派需要比他们的美国同行更拼命地取得成功，而且他们愿意为成功付出代价，而其他人则不然。Ochoa市长必须信守诺言，对这个问题做点什么。在此之前，自由城无助的居民必须听任这些外国暴徒的摆布。

;0x2DC2CB69=Bobby Jefferson, the Ex-Secretary of Security Enforcement, came to Liberty City in order to give a speech on the increasing threat of immigrant-led organized crime. However, Jefferson became a victim himself as his convoy was ambushed on the way to the Civic Citadel and he was nearly killed. Violent crime is becoming more and more prevalent in this city and people like Mr. Jefferson are asking why in highly paid speeches. The RICO statutes and the pressure put on organized crime by new forms of surveillance has for years undermined the traditional criminal elements in this city. This void is being filled by hungry and ruthless criminals coming into our city from abroad.
0x2DC2CB69=前安全执行秘书Bobby Jefferson来到自由城，就移民领导的有组织犯罪的日益严重的威胁发表演讲。然而，Jefferson自己成为受害者，因为他的车队在去公民城堡的路上被伏击，他差点被杀。暴力犯罪在这个城市越来越普遍，像Jefferson先生这样的人在高收入的演讲中问为什么。多年来，RICO(组织犯罪取缔法)的法规和新形式的监视对有组织犯罪施加的压力破坏了该市的传统犯罪分子。饥饿无情的罪犯从国外来到我们的城市，填补了这一空白。

;0x8A7F968B=Nightlife king, "Gay" Tony Prince spoke out yesterday after he had two clubs closed by the city. He said that the city should not try to turn itself into a version of the Midwest. Mr. Prince, who has run clubs in the city for 25 years, been to rehab 5 times, and also incarcerated for tax evasion, commented, "I don't have a traditional family. I don't care about family values. That's why l live and work in Liberty City. If I wanted to go to bed at 8pm and worry about noise and hate people who weren't identical to me, I would go and live in Ohio. Nothing against Ohio. I went there once. I just used it as an example. Liberty City is supposed to be threatening and dangerous and challenging. Right now, it's about as challenging as a dog show." The LCPD spokesman we interviewed noted, "Mr. Prince's clubs were violating 8 city ordinances, and were undoubtedly places where drugs were being consumed. He is lucky he is not back in jail."
0x8A7F968B=夜生活之王，风流Tony Prince昨天发表讲话，因为他有两个俱乐部在城市关闭了。他说，这个城市不应该试图把自己变成中西部的一个版本。Prince先生在该市经营俱乐部已有25年，他曾5次去戒毒所，还因逃税而被监禁。他评论说：「我没有传统的家庭。我不在乎家庭价值观。所以我才在自由城生活和工作。如果我想晚上8点上床睡觉，担心噪音，讨厌和我不一样的人，我会去俄亥俄州住。不反对俄亥俄。我去过一次。我只是用它作为例子。自由城应该具有威胁性、危险性和挑战性。现在，它就像一场狗展一样具有挑战性。「我们采访的LCPD发言人指出：「普林斯的俱乐部违反了8项城市法令，无疑是吸毒的地方。他很幸运没有回到监狱。」

;0xF07B8EA1=These are lies. Our workforce is strictly volunteer now and besides, what would you rather do? Starve or earn 10 cents an hour? 401k and gym membership isn't going to put food on their floor. Children require less sleep and women are better at multi-tasking. It's simply good business sense. We spend billions every year on advertising and celebrity endorsements and that has to come from somewhere." The battle over morality vs. overpriced sports fashion continues to rage. Many of Eris's sponsored athletes came out in support of the company, saying they were each getting paid $10 million to wear the logo and the human rights scandal is overblown.
0xF07B8EA1=这些都是谎言,我们的员工现在是严格的志愿者，此外，你愿意做什么？开始还是每小时赚10美分？401k和健身房成员不会把食物放在他们的地板上。孩子们需要较少的睡眠，女性在多任务时更好。这只是很好的商业意识。我们每年都在广告和名人的支持上花费数十亿，这必须来自某个地方。」关于道德与昂贵运动时尚的斗争继续愤怒。Eris赞助的许多运动员都是为了支持该公司而来的，他们说他们每个人都得到了1000万美元来佩戴这个标志，而人权丑闻是过分的。
