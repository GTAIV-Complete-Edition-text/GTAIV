;0x1B8CA6FD=It seems that, as in every industry, these new gangs need to succeed more desperately than their American counterparts and they are willing to pay a price for success that others are not. Mayor Ochoa has to keep to his word and do something about this problem. Until then, the helpless residents of Liberty City must remain at the mercy of these foreign thugs.
0x1B8CA6FD=新势力必须比原有的本土势力更加凶狠，而新势力也愿意为成功付出其他势力不愿付出的代价，看来这一规律在很多领域适用。Ochoa市长必须信守诺言，对这个问题采取行动。在他采取行动之前，自由城的无助居民只能任由这些外国暴徒摆布。

;0x2756001F=Eris founder, Pete Vassal, finally responded to the barrage of criticism over the company's use of child labor with a defiant message on <a href="www.erisfootware.com/shoes_meassage_1.html">www.erisfootware.com</a>: "Eris receives a lot of flak in the liberal media for its corporate practices, especially our third-world production line.
0x2756001F=Eris公司创始人Pete Vassal终于回应了对该公司使用童工的大量批评，他的回应刊登在_<a href="www.erisfootware.com/shoes_meassage_1.html">www.erisfootware.com</a>_，充满了挑衅气息：「Eris因其企业方针，遭到了自由派媒体的强烈抨击，对我们第三世界生产线的抨击尤为严重。

;0x2DC2CB69=Bobby Jefferson, the Ex-Secretary of Security Enforcement, came to Liberty City in order to give a speech on the increasing threat of immigrant-led organized crime. However, Jefferson became a victim himself as his convoy was ambushed on the way to the Civic Citadel and he was nearly killed. Violent crime is becoming more and more prevalent in this city and people like Mr. Jefferson are asking why in highly paid speeches. The RICO statutes and the pressure put on organized crime by new forms of surveillance has for years undermined the traditional criminal elements in this city. This void is being filled by hungry and ruthless criminals coming into our city from abroad.
0x2DC2CB69=前国安办主任Bobby Jefferson来到自由城，就日益严重的移民犯罪组织的威胁发表演讲。然而Jefferson自己也成为了移民犯罪的受害者，他的车队在前往市政厅途中遇袭，他也差点遇害。暴力犯罪在这个城市越来越普遍，像Jefferson先生这样的人也常常在演讲中质问原因(这类人的演讲费也很高)。多年来，组织犯罪取缔法(RICO)和新式监视手段有效打击了本市的传统犯罪组织。而多年来打击下产生的空间正被饥饿无情的外国罪犯填补。

;0x8A7F968B=Nightlife king, "Gay" Tony Prince spoke out yesterday after he had two clubs closed by the city. He said that the city should not try to turn itself into a version of the Midwest. Mr. Prince, who has run clubs in the city for 25 years, been to rehab 5 times, and also incarcerated for tax evasion, commented, "I don't have a traditional family. I don't care about family values. That's why l live and work in Liberty City. If I wanted to go to bed at 8pm and worry about noise and hate people who weren't identical to me, I would go and live in Ohio. Nothing against Ohio. I went there once. I just used it as an example. Liberty City is supposed to be threatening and dangerous and challenging. Right now, it's about as challenging as a dog show." The LCPD spokesman we interviewed noted, "Mr. Prince's clubs were violating 8 city ordinances, and were undoubtedly places where drugs were being consumed. He is lucky he is not back in jail."
0x8A7F968B=夜生活之王「基佬」Tony Prince经营的两家夜店被当局勒令停业。昨天他对此事进行了表态，称自由城不应成为中西部的翻版。Prince先生在自由城经营夜店已有25年，被判5次强制戒毒，还曾因逃税而被监禁。他评论说：「我没有传统的家庭，我不在乎家庭观念，所以我才在自由城生活、工作。如果才八点我就想睡了，一边还担心噪音、讨厌那些跟我不同的人，我就会选择搬到俄亥俄住。我不是要抹黑俄亥俄，那里我去过一次，我只是拿它举个例子。自由城应该具有威胁、富于危险、充满挑战。现在，自由城的挑战水平大概跟狗狗秀差不多。」我们采访的LCPD发言人指出：「Prince先生的夜店违反了8项城市条例，而且我们确定他的夜店是吸毒场所。没把他抓回监狱已经是他走运了。」

;0xF07B8EA1=These are lies. Our workforce is strictly volunteer now and besides, what would you rather do? Starve or earn 10 cents an hour? 401k and gym membership isn't going to put food on their floor. Children require less sleep and women are better at multi-tasking. It's simply good business sense. We spend billions every year on advertising and celebrity endorsements and that has to come from somewhere." The battle over morality vs. overpriced sports fashion continues to rage. Many of Eris's sponsored athletes came out in support of the company, saying they were each getting paid $10 million to wear the logo and the human rights scandal is overblown.
0xF07B8EA1=但这些抨击都是谎言。我们的工人一直都是自愿工作，如果让你选，你会选择饿死还是10美分的时薪？企业年金和健身房使用权可没法让他们填饱肚子。童工需要的睡眠时间更短，女性更擅长一心多用。这是很正常的商业考量。我们每年都会在广告宣传和名人代言上投入数十亿资金，这笔钱总得有个来由。」这场关于道德和价格虚高的运动产品的争论仍在持续，而且愈演愈烈。许多Eris赞助的运动员为Eris公司发声，表示他们都拿到了一千万的代言费，所谓的人权丑闻是夸大其辞。
