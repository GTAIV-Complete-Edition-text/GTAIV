;0x053FB18B=Since we were stupid enough to reopen the bridges around the metropolitan area, traffic has got much worse. At the same time, terrorists are now running wild about the city, in incredible numbers, we imagine. Next time you are on a bridge, look around you. Those other cars are full of terrorists, trying to blow up our freedom.
0x053FB18B=自从我们蠢到重新开放大都会周边的大桥后，交通状况就差了许多。与此同时，依我们看，数量极多的恐怖分子正在城市里肆意行动。下次你开车上桥的时候，看看你的周围，那些车里都是试图破坏我们自由的恐怖分子。

;0x227EEC09=Well, beat them to it. Restrict your own freedom and help the environment, if you care about that sort of nonsense - support the proposals to shut the bridges permanently. These radical ideas were suggested by Martin Hawes, a man so freethinking the liberals locked him up. We say close the lunatic asylums. Turn them into detention centers for undesirables of a different sort, and close the bridges now.
0x227EEC09=那就抢占先机吧。限制你的自由然后保护环境吧，如果你真的在乎什么环境——拥护永久关闭大桥的议案吧。这些激进的想法是由Martin Hawes提出的，他的思想太过自由，以至于自由派把他关了起来。我们提议关闭疯人院，改造成看守所关押各种不良分子，然后立刻封锁大桥。
