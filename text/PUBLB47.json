Now that our pensions have been blown on conservative war-games, it is easy to see how even the most ludicrous online scam could start to look appealing. President Lawton and his band of thieves have turned the US economy into a ticking time bomb. Move to India - you will be better off in the long run.",

The scheme, entitled the 'Roman Empire Wealth System', promised returns of millions on an initial investment of $20,000. It comes as no shock that Wolfe would jump at the chance to become Julius Caesar: the two of them are vying for the top spot in the competition for the biggest egomaniac in history. Wolfe is now under investigation following reports that he publicly endorsed the scheme in a desperate attempt to speed up online subscriptions.It is a terrifying state of affairs that this man's manipulative words have the power to move global markets. You are better off taking financial advice from a compulsive gambler in Las Venturas.",
