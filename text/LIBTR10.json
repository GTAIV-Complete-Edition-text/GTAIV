It's the stuff of nightmares - police have admitted they are concerned about similarities in a series of murder cases over the past few years, making them think a serial killer may be at work in Liberty City. The killer, who's yet to be given a nickname, seems to have a particular thing against keep-fit enthusiasts as the three victims so far were joggers. Each had been decapitated after running late at night. It seems we are in for a news bonanza as we consider the ramifications of this terrifying case in gruesome detail and try to figure out exactly who will star in the movie.

Others just don't like the Liberty City \"attitude\". Whatever the reason, Liberty City has never been in more danger of being hit by a terrorist attack than it is today.
