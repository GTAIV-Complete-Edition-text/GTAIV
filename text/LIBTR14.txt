;0x8B125771=The Broker Bridge, the Algonquin Bridge, the East Borough Bridge, the Northwood Heights Bridge, the Hickey Bridge and the Booth Tunnel have remained closed since the threat of Terrorism escalated over the summer. Thousands of Liberty City residents are failing to reach work each day and having to resort to public transport. Experts estimate that this is costing Liberty City business millions of dollars a day. Surely it is time for Mayor Julio Ochoa to reopen these bridges?
0x8B125771=自今年夏天的恐怖主义威胁升级以来，Broker大桥、Algonquin大桥、东区大桥、Northwood高地大桥、Hickey大桥以及Booth隧道一直处于关闭状态。成千上万的自由城居民无法准时上班，被迫搭乘公共交通。据专家估算，这种情况每天将给自由城的企业造成上百万损失。Julio Ochoa市长也差不多该开放这些大桥了吧？

;0xA164872A=The serial killer our unimaginative police force and media cannot name has struck again. This time, a jogger in Alderney got the chop as a headless body was found in some bushes by the river. The body had been badly mutilated and taken advantage of, and police have still not identified the victim. Local residents are starting to panic. One local heavy-set woman, Siobhan Phillips, told us, "They say keeping fit is good for you; well, it wasn't good for this man - he went running and had his head chopped off by a maniac." Of greater concern for many is the failure by our police force to name the killer. Surely a man who chops off heads for fun could inspire a funny nickname or moniker of some sort?
0xA164872A=我们缺乏想象力的警察和媒体还没替他想好外号，这个连环杀手就再次犯案了。这次的死者是一位住在Alderney的慢跑者，警方在河边的灌木丛中发现了他的无头尸体。尸体受到了严重摧残，还曾遭到性侵，目前警方仍未确认死者身份。当地居民开始恐慌。当地一位魁梧的女士Siobhan Phillips告诉我们：「都说健身有好处，结果你看看他，出门跑个步，头就被一个疯子砍了，哪有什么好处。」不过大多数人更加担忧的是，警方至今未能给这个杀手命名。对于一个以砍头为乐的人，怎么说都不至于想不到一个像样点的绰号或者代号给他吧？

;0xB1502701=Police admitted they were baffled by their failure in this regard and put it down to a change in demographics since 1977. One cop, who refused to be named, blamed "a culture of equality; the fact is, non whites are just not funny. In the old days, we'd make racist jokes and have a great time; now people get all excited about racial equality, and the result - anarchy on our streets." Whatever the cause, the failure to give this serial killer a nickname is likely to damage future movie rights and book deals. Detective Jon Atkinson asked that we mention him in this story, so we just have.
0xB1502701=警方承认他们被取名难住了，并将其归咎于1977年以来的人口结构变化。一位不愿透露姓名的警官表示：「都怪追求平等的文化。实际上，现在的非白人实在是无趣。想当年，我们可以讲种族主义的笑话，大家都很开心；现在，种族平权令人振奋，结果就是现在城里的无政府状态。」不论原因如何，没能给这一连环杀手起名很有可能对未来的电影改编和图书市场造成巨大负面影响。Jon Atkinson警探要求我们在本报道中提到他一次，现在就提到了。
