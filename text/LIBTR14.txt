;0x8B125771=The Broker Bridge, the Algonquin Bridge, the East Borough Bridge, the Northwood Heights Bridge, the Hickey Bridge and the Booth Tunnel have remained closed since the threat of Terrorism escalated over the summer. Thousands of Liberty City residents are failing to reach work each day and having to resort to public transport. Experts estimate that this is costing Liberty City business millions of dollars a day. Surely it is time for Mayor Julio Ochoa to reopen these bridges?
0x8B125771=自今年夏天的恐怖主义威胁升级以来，Broker大桥、Algonquin大桥、East Borough大桥、Northwood Heights大桥、Hickey大桥以及Booth隧道一直处于关闭状态。数以千计的自由城居民每天工作迟到以至于不得不搭乘公共交通。专家估计，这将使自由城的企业每日亏损数百万美元。Julio Ochoa市长是否该重新开放这些桥梁了？

;0xA164872A=The serial killer our unimaginative police force and media cannot name has struck again. This time, a jogger in Alderney got the chop as a headless body was found in some bushes by the river. The body had been badly mutilated and taken advantage of, and police have still not identified the victim. Local residents are starting to panic. One local heavy-set woman, Siobhan Phillips, told us, "They say keeping fit is good for you; well, it wasn't good for this man - he went running and had his head chopped off by a maniac." Of greater concern for many is the failure by our police force to name the killer. Surely a man who chops off heads for fun could inspire a funny nickname or moniker of some sort?
0xA164872A=我们缺乏想象力的警察和媒体都说不出名字的连环杀手再度犯案。这一次，一位来自Alderney的慢跑者被砍杀，因为一具无头尸体在河边的灌木丛中被发现。尸体被严重肢解和利用，警方依然无法判定受害者身份。当地居民开始恐慌。当地一位魁梧的女士Siobhan Phillips透露，「他们说保持锻炼对你有好处，对这个男人可就不是了 - 他去跑步结果头被一个疯子砍了下来」对许多人来说，更令人担忧的是我们的警察无法给出凶手的名字。一个以砍头为乐的人肯定能得到一个有趣的绰号或类似的绰号吧?

;0xB1502701=Police admitted they were baffled by their failure in this regard and put it down to a change in demographics since 1977. One cop, who refused to be named, blamed "a culture of equality; the fact is, non whites are just not funny. In the old days, we'd make racist jokes and have a great time; now people get all excited about racial equality, and the result - anarchy on our streets." Whatever the cause, the failure to give this serial killer a nickname is likely to damage future movie rights and book deals. Detective Jon Atkinson asked that we mention him in this story, so we just have.
0xB1502701=警方表示，他们对自己在这方面的失败感到困惑，并将其归因于1977年以来人口结构的变化。一位不愿透露姓名的警察将此归咎于「一种平等的文化；事实是，非白人一点也不有趣。在过去，我们会讲种族主义笑话，玩得很开心；现在，人们对种族平等感到兴奋，结果就是街头的无政府状态。」不管原因是什么，没有成功给这个连环杀手取个绰号很可能会损害未来的电影版权和图书市场。Jon Atkinson警探要求我们在这个故事中提到他，所以我们就这么做了。
