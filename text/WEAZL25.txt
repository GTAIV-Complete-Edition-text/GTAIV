;0xA27525BD=National Office of Security Enforcement agents have intercepted some high quality counterfeit 100-dollar bills abroad. The government is calling these bills 'supernotes' because of the quality of ink and paper being used in their production. While they have only so far been found in Amsterdam and Belfast, authorities believe that the notes are being manufactured with the backing of a national government. Speculation is rampant that this is the work of a terrorist state or a communist power. To this reporter, however, a campaign this cowardly and vindictive points to only one possible perpetrator - France.
0xA27525BD=国家安全办公室的探员查获了一批假钞，这种假钞质量极高，系从海外流入本国。因其印刷所采用的油墨和纸张质量较好，政府将这种假钞称为「超级钞」。尽管目前我们只在阿姆斯特丹和贝尔法斯特发现了这种假钞，但有关部门认为这些假钞系由具有国家政府背景的组织制造。有猜测称这是恐怖主义国家或共产主义政权所为。然而在笔者眼中，这种软弱的报复性行为只可能出自一个国家——法国。
