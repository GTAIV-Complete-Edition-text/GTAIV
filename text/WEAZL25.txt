;0xA27525BD=National Office of Security Enforcement agents have intercepted some high quality counterfeit 100-dollar bills abroad. The government is calling these bills 'supernotes' because of the quality of ink and paper being used in their production. While they have only so far been found in Amsterdam and Belfast, authorities believe that the notes are being manufactured with the backing of a national government. Speculation is rampant that this is the work of a terrorist state or a communist power. To this reporter, however, a campaign this cowardly and vindictive points to only one possible perpetrator - France.
0xA27525BD=National Office of Security Enforcement的探员已查获一批高质量的进口百元假钞。因为其制造所使用的高质量油墨和纸张，政府称这些钞票为「超级钞票」。虽然这些钞票在阿姆斯特丹和贝尔法斯特被查获，官方相信这些假钞是由一批有官方背景的人制作的。有猜测称这是一猖獗的共产主义恐怖政权所为。然而对于这位记者来说，这场如此懦弱的报复行动直指一个嫌犯——法国。
